  abstract = {Since 1975, the US has seen a decrease in vehicle crash fatalities, noticeably among recent model vehicles. However, a lack of requirement to test motor vehicles using anthropomorphic test devices representative of both the average male and the average female occupant may be driving a disparity in the risk of fatality in severe crash scenarios. The double pair comparison method, first developed by Evans, was applied to many different cross-sections of the US Fatality Analysis Reporting System to investigate sex-dependent differences in relative fatality risk in crashes. Despite a dramatic decline in fatalities over the reporting period, female vehicle occupants aged 20\textendash 30 years are 20\textendash 25\% more likely to die as a result of a fatal crash than males in the same age range. The risk to females and males becomes similar as age increases to 60. These trends hold when looking at subsets of crashes in either rural or urban areas, when looking at vehicles manufactured since 2010, and when isolating by single, two- or multiple-vehicle crashes. The consistency of this age-dependent relative risk emphasises a need to further investigate sex differences in crash-related outcomes.},

  abstract = {Design optimization of structural and multidisciplinary systems under uncertainty has been an active area of research due to its evident advantages over deterministic design optimization. In deterministic design optimization, the uncertainties of a structural or multidisciplinary system are taken into account by using safety factors specified in the regulations or design codes. This uncertainty treatment is a subjective and indirect way of dealing with uncertainty. On the other hand, design under uncertainty approaches provide an objective and direct way of dealing with uncertainty. This paper provides a review of the uncertainty treatment practices in design optimization of structural and multidisciplinary systems under uncertainties. To this end, the activities in uncertainty modeling are first reviewed, where theories and methods on uncertainty categorization (or classification), uncertainty handling (or management), and uncertainty characterization are discussed. Second, the tools and techniques developed and used for uncertainty modeling and propagation are discussed under the broad two classes of probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches. Third, various design optimization methods under uncertainty which incorporate all the techniques covered in uncertainty modeling and analysis are reviewed. In addition to these in-depth reviews on uncertainty modeling, uncertainty analysis, and design optimization under uncertainty, some real-life engineering applications and benchmark test examples are provided in this paper so that readers can develop an appreciation on where and how the discussed techniques can be applied and how to compare them. Finally, concluding remarks are provided, and areas for future research are suggested.},

  abstract = {There is currently a gap in the literature that quantitatively describes the complex bone microarchitecture within the diplo\"e (trabecular bone) and cortical layers of the human calvarium. The purpose of this study was to determine the morphometric properties of the diplo\"e and cortical tables of the human calvarium in which key interacting factors of sex, location on the calvarium, and layers of the sandwich structure were considered. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) was utilized to capture images at 18~{$\mu$}m resolution of male (n~=~26) and female (n~=~24) embalmed calvarium specimens in the frontal and parietal regions (N~=~50). All images were post-processed and analyzed using vendor bundled CT-Analyzer software to determine the morphometric properties of the diplo\"e and cortical layers. A two-way mixed (repeated measures) analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine diplo\"e morphometric properties accounting for factors of sex and location. A three-way mixed ANOVA was performed to determine cortical morphometric properties accounting for factors of cortical layer (inner and outer table), sex, and location. The study revealed no two-way interaction effects between sex and location on the diplo\"e morphometry except for fractal dimension. Trabecular thickness and separation in the diplo\"e were significantly greater in the male specimens; however, females showed a greater number of trabeculae and fractal dimension on average. Parietal specimens revealed a greater porosity, trabecular separation, and deviation from an ideal plate structure, but a lesser number of trabeculae and connectivity compared to the frontal location. Additionally, the study observed a lower density and greater porosity in the inner cortical layer than the outer which may be due to clear distinctions between each layer's physiological environment. The study provides valuable insight into the quantitative morphometry of the calvarium in which finite element modelers of the skull can refer to when designing detailed heterogenous or subject-specific skull models to effectively predict injury. Furthermore, this study contributes towards the recent developments on physical surrogate models of the skull which require approximate measures of calvarium bone architecture in order to effectively fabricate a model and then accurately simulate a traumatic head impact event.},

The microstructure was characterized using microcomputed ﻿tomography (micro-﻿CT) at about 6-{$\mu$}m resolution to map the change of porosity as a function of the depth, P(d), from the inner surface nearest to the brain to the outer surface nearest to the skin. A quantifiable method was developed using the measured P(d) to objectively distinguish between the three layers of the skull: the outer table, diplo\"e\,, and inner table. The thickness and average porosity of each of the layers were then calculated from the measured porosity distributions, and a Gaussian function was fit to the P(d) curves. Morphological parameters were compared between the two bone types (frontal and parietal), while accounting for skull-to-skull variability. Parietal bones generally had a larger diplo\"e\,accompanied by a thinner inner table. The arrangement of the porous vesicular structure within the outer table was also obtained with micro-CT scans with longer scan times, using enhanced parameters for higher resolution and lower noise in the images. From these scans, the porous structure of the bone appeared to be randomly arranged in the transverse plane, compared to the porous structure of the human femur, which is aligned in the loading direction.},

The BVF-morphology (bone volume fraction) of these specimens had been previously characterized in detail and reported, with high-resolution micro-computed tomography at \textasciitilde 5\,{$\mu$}m resolution. A subset of these specimens was loaded in the direction normal to the outer surface in quasi-static compression. In contrast to many previous mechanical characterization studies of skulls, following two additional procedures were used in this study. (1) Fresh skull specimens were used, which were stored refrigerated before mechanical loading, instead of using embalmed or dried specimens. (2) Furthermore, using digital image correlation, non-contact full-field inhomogeneous strain measurements were made using the speckled specimen surfaces and the compression platens, also avoiding possible errors in strain measurements from machine compliance and due to irregularities in the loading surfaces of the specimen. The averaged far-field compressive mechanical response was obtained from these local full-field measurements on the composite bone specimens. Assuming a layered structure for the skull bone, using the local averaged full-field strain measurements of each layer, a power law was used to represent the relationship between initial mechanical response and the averaged BVF of the layers. Using the measured porosity maps of the rest of the non-compressed specimens, this relationship was used to predict the modulus-depth dependency of the skull bone and the variabilities associated with the structure. The mechanical properties and density as a function of the normalized thickness of the skull are presented for use in finite element simulations to model the skull with the desired degrees of complexities, also based on the region of action, depending on the goals of the computer simulation of the impact: either as a single homogenous layer, three-layer sandwich, multilayer heterogeneous or continuous elemental structure. In addition, a power law was derived relating the compressive failure strength and bone volume fraction (BVF) for the skull bone.},

Recent advances in medical management of SCI has significantly improved diagnosis, stabilization, survival rate and well-being of SCI patients. However, there has been small progress on treatment options for improving the neurological outcomes of SCI patients. This incremental success mainly reflects the complexity of SCI pathophysiology and the diverse biochemical and physiological changes that occur in the injured spinal cord. Therefore, in the past few decades, considerable efforts have been made by SCI researchers to elucidate the pathophysiology of SCI and unravel the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of tissue degeneration and repair in the injured spinal cord. To this end, a number of preclinical animal and injury models have been developed to more closely recapitulate the primary and secondary injury processes of SCI. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of SCI. We will also discuss the neurological outcomes of human SCI and the available experimental model systems that have been employed to identify SCI mechanisms and develop therapeutic strategies for this condition.}

Many models have been created and evaluated with limited experimental data and without accounting for subject-specific morphometry of the specimens in the dataset. Recent advancements in the measurement of brain motion using sonomicrometry allow for a comprehensive evaluation of brain model biofidelity using a high-rate, rotational brain motion dataset. In this study, four methods were used to determine the best technique to compare nodal displacement to experimental brain motion, including a new morphing method to match subject-specific inner skull geometry. Three finite element brain models were evaluated in this study: the isotropic GHBMC and SIMon models, as well as an anisotropic model with explicitly embedded axons (UVA-EAM). Using a weighted cross-correlation score (between 0 and 1), the anisotropic model yielded the highest average scores across specimens and loading conditions ranging from 0.53 to 0.63, followed by the isotropic GHBMC with average scores ranging from 0.46 to 0.58, and then the SIMon model with average scores ranging from 0.36 to 0.51. The choice of comparison method did not significantly affect the cross-correlation score, and differences of global strain up to 0.1 were found for the morphed geometry relative to baseline models. The morphed or scaled geometry is recommended when evaluating computational brain models to capture the subject-specific skull geometry of the experimental specimens.},

Our understanding of human brain mechanics is primarily informed by animal models, mechanical property experiments of brain tissue, and computational models. The previous chapters focus on the computational modeling of the brain aimed at predicting and mitigating traumatic brain injury. The experimental validation of computational brain models with respect to human brain deformation data is requisite for their efficacy and capacity to predict injury and assist in the design of safety equipment. Datasets of human brain deformation exist, but they include limitations that preclude their use for model validation. Several techniques have been developed in the past two decades to acquire in situ and in vivo human brain deformation measurements, including X-ray, sonomicrometry, and magnetic resonance imaging. While most models are validated to a partial set of experiments from one brain deformation dataset, there is a need to expand the availability of brain deformation data and to standardize the methods of evaluating and validating computational brain models.},

  abstract = {Recent epidemiology studies have reported increase in lumbar spine injuries in frontal crashes. Whole human body finite element models (FEHBM) are frequently used to delineate mechanisms of such injuries. However, the accuracy of these models in mimicking the response of human spine relies on the characterization data of the spine model. The current study set out to generate characterization data that can be input to FEHBM lumbar spine, to obtain biofidelic responses from the models. Twenty-five lumbar functional spinal units were tested under compressive loading. A hydraulic testing machine was used to load the superior ends of the specimens. A 75N load was placed on the superior PMMA to remove the laxity in the joint and mimic the physiological load. There were three loading sequences, namely, preconditioning, 0.5 m/s (non-injurious) and 1.0 m/s (failure). Forces and displacements were collected using six-axis load cell and VICON targets. In addition, acoustic signals were collected to identify the times of failures. Finally, response corridors were generated for the two speeds. To demonstrate the corridors, GHBMC FE model was simulated in frontal impact condition with the default and updated lumbar stiffness. Bi-linear trend was observed in the force versus displacement plots. In the 0.5 m/s tests, mean toe- and linear-region stiffnesses were 0.96{$\pm$}0.37 and 2.44{$\pm$}0.92 kN/mm. In 1.0 m/s tests, the toe and linear-region stiffnesses were 1.13{$\pm$}0.56 and 4.6{$\pm$}2.5 kN/mm. Lumbar joints demonstrated 2.5 times higher stiffness in the linear-region when the loading rate was increased by 0.5 m/s.},

  abstract = {Elucidating the mechanisms of mild traumatic brain injuries (mild TBIs), including concussions, is important for developing brain injury criteria and designing head protection devices. Using a finite element (FE) model of the human brain to predict the deformation of the brain parenchyma during a head impact could provide mechanical insights on mild TBIs. However, most conventional brain FE models do not consider how fluid behavior and the perfusion pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will affect brain deformation. This study proposes a novel brain FE model that uses incompressible fluid dynamics (ICFD) to represent the fluid behavior of CSF in the ventricle. In the model with ICFD, the validation accuracy scores on the brain strain during a head impact with a rotational acceleration were significantly higher than those in the model without ICFD. Reconstruction simulations based on two reported mild TBI cases from a rear-end collision and an American football game were conducted using the model with and without ICFD. We found that the maximum principal strain values in the subcortical region and corpus callosum of the model with ICFD were higher and lasted longer than those of the model without ICFD, and this tendency was further enhanced when perfusion pressure was applied. These findings suggested that the fluid behavior and perfusion pressure of the intraventricular CSF could significantly affect the deformation of the brain parenchyma during head impacts. The proposed brain multiphysical FE model could enhance the understanding of mild TBI mechanisms.},

Research libraries are well placed to make that revolution happen, and LIBER's Open Science Roadmap outlines the specific actions libraries can take to champion Open Science, both within and beyond their own institutions. As we explain in detail throughout this document, libraries need to advocate for Open Science locally and internationally, to support Open Science through tools and services and to expand the impact of their work through collaboration and partnerships. LIBER has shaped its 2018-2022 Strategy to support and enable Open Science and it is our hope that this Roadmap will help Europe's research libraries to do the same. This document was written during spring 2018, when the Open Science Policy Platform (OSPP) produced integrated advice for the EC and key stakeholders.

  abstract = {This paper uses NASS 2004-2013 to estimate the population of belted front seat occupants exposed to far-side crashes and those with serious injuries. The use of the most recent ten years of NASS data permitted an update of the characteristics of far-side crashes that are associated with serious injuries among belted front seat occupants. When compared with earlier studies, it was found that the vehicle category that includes SUV's, pickups and vans, has increased as the collision partner in far-side crashes. There has likewise been an increase in the median crash severity for MAIS 3+ injured. For the 2004-2013 NASS CDS data, the median crash severity for MAIS 3+ injured was a lateral delta V of 36 kph. Chest/abdominal injuries accounted for 43\% and head injuries accounted for 23\% of the AIS 3+ injuries. Drivers accounted for 79\% of the MAIS 3+ injured belted front outboard occupants that were involved in far-side crashes. About 53\% of front outboard occupant's chest injuries were caused by contacts with the vehicle center stack or seat back and 21\% were associated with contacts with the far-side structure. In regards to head injuries, the far side structure accounts for more than 60\% of the AIS 3+ injuries. Of the far side crash involved occupants analyzed, they sustained AIS3+ head or chest injuries from the far side of the vehicle more than 4.4 times more often than were attributed to occupant to occupant contact. Another striking trend is the disproportionate number of AIS3+ injured occupants in light passenger cars where belted front outboard occupants sustained severe injuries at a rate 2.7 times higher than exposed. Finally, this study identified that only 3.1\% of belted AIS3+ injured occupants involved in far-side collisions sustained their injuries due to head to head contact with another front seat occupant.},

We develop herein a computational method to study brain injury biomechanics considering the cerebral cortex convolutions. The mechanical boundary conditions used for our mesoscale study were driven from a higher length scale FEA of American football helmet-to-helmet hits that were experimentally validated. In this regard, time\textendash pressure histories from different brain lobes (parietal, temporal, occipital, and frontal lobes) were garnered from the higher scale FEA and applied to the mesoscale FE simulations such that the stress wave propagations of the cerebral cortex were examined. We were able to quantify the cortical morphometry variations in our simulations by differentiating between gray and white matter, incorporating pia mater and cerebrospinal fluid interfacial properties, and including differences between different brain lobes. In the near field local regions, the sulci led to a high von Mises stress concentration at its end (18.0 kPa), which is approximately 39 times greater than simulations without sulci (0.5 kPa). In the far field, stress field interactions arose from different sulci generating a secondary von Mises stress concentration that was 23\% greater when compared to one sulcus (from 12.0 kPa to 14.8 kPa). Finally, the FEA showed that the maximum von Mises stress was smaller for the parietal and temporal lobes (6.3\textendash 11.1 kPa) compared to the frontal and occipital lobes (18.0\textendash 19.0 kPa).},

  abstract = {Injury risk curves (IRCs) represent the quantification of risk of adverse outcomes, such as a bone fracture, quantified by a biomechanical metric such as force or deflection. From a biomechanical perspective, they are crucial in crashworthiness studies to advance human safety. In clinical settings, they can be used as an assistive tool to aid in the decision-making process for surgical or conservative treatment. The estimation of risk corresponding to a level of biomechanical metric is done using a regression technique, such as a parametric survival regression model. As with any statistical procedure, error measures are computed for the IRC, representing the quality of the estimated risk. For example, confidence intervals (CIs) are recommended by the International Standards Organization, and the normalized confidence interval width (NCIW) is computed based on the width of the CI. This is a surrogate for the quality of the risk curve. A 95\% CI means that if the same experiment were hypothetically repeated 100 times, at least 95 of the computed CIs should contain the true risk curve. Such an interpretation is problematic in most biomechanical contexts as rarely the same experiment is repeated. The notion that a wider confidence interval implies a poorer quality risk curve can be misleading. This article considers the evaluation of CIs and its implications in biomechanical settings for safety engineering and clinical practice. Alternatives are suggested for future studies.},

Computational models of the human head have been developed over the years, reaching high levels of detail, complexity, and precision. However, most of the attention has been devoted to the brain and other intracranial structures. The skull, despite playing a major role in direct head impacts, is often overlooked and simplified. In this work, a new skull model is developed for the authors\&rsquo; head model, the YEAHM, based on the original outer geometry, but segmenting it with sutures, diplo\&euml;, and cortical bone, having variable thickness across different head sections and based on medical craniometric data. These structures are modeled with constitutive models that consider the non-linear behavior of skull bones and also the nature of their failure. Several validations are performed, comparing the simulation results with experimental results available in the literature at several levels: (i) local material validation; (ii) blunt trauma from direct impact against stationary skull; (iii) three impacts at different velocities simulating falls; (iv) blunt ballistic temporoparietal head impacts. Accelerations, impact forces, and fracture patterns are used to validate the skull model.},

We report a workflow named continuous analysis that can build reproducibility into computational analyses.

This allows results to be accurately reproduced without needing to contact the study authors. Continuous analysis allows reviewers, editors or readers to verify reproducibility without manually downloading and re-running any code and can provide an audit trail for analyses of data that cannot be shared.},

However, there is little information on how the pattern of disco-ligamentous injury affects the SCI severity and mechanism. This study objective was to analyze how different flexion-distraction disco-ligamentous injuries affect the SCI mechanisms during post-traumatic flexion and extension. A cervical spine finite element model including the spinal cord was used and different combinations of partial or complete intervertebral disc (IVD) rupture and disruption of various posterior ligaments were modeled at C4-C5, C5-C6 or C6-C7. In flexion, complete IVD rupture combined with posterior ligamentous complex rupture was the most severe injury leading to the most extreme von Mises stress (47 to 66 kPa), principal strains p1 (0.32 to 0.41 in white matter) and p3 (-0.78 to -0.96 in white matter) in the spinal cord and to the most important spinal cord compression (35 to 48 \%). The main post-trauma SCI mechanism was identified as compression of the anterior white matter at the injured level combined with distraction of the posterior spinal cord during flexion. There was also a concentration of the maximum stresses in the gray matter after injury. Finally, in extension, the injuries tested had little impact on the spinal cord. The capsular ligament was the most important structure in protecting the spinal cord. Its status should be carefully examined during patient's management.},

Excursions of select anatomical regions were normalized to their respective initial positions and compared by test condition and between subject types. The forward excursions of the select anatomical regions generally increased with increasing severity. The forward excursions of relaxed human volunteers were significantly larger than those of the ATD for nearly every region at both severities. The forward excursions of the upper body regions of the braced volunteers were generally significantly smaller than those of the ATD at both severities. Forward excursions of the relaxed human volunteers and PMHSs were fairly similar except the head CG response at both severities and the right knee and C7 at the medium severity. The forward excursions of the upper body of the PMHS were generally significantly larger than those of the braced volunteers at both severities. Forward excursions of the PMHSs exceeded those of the ATD for all regions at both severities with significant differences within the upper body regions.

  abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of active muscles (e.g. conscious bracing, resting tone, and reflex response) and acceleration severity on the neck forces and moments generated during low-speed frontal sled tests with adult male human volunteers and post mortem human surrogates (PMHSs).Methods: A total of 24 frontal sled tests were analyzed including male volunteers of approximately 50th percentile height and weight (n = 5) and PMHSs (n = 2). The tests were performed at two acceleration severities: low ({$\sim$}2.5 g, {$\Delta$}v {$\approx$} 5 kph) and medium ({$\sim$}5.0 g, {$\Delta$}v {$\approx$} 10 kph). Each volunteer was exposed to two impulses at each severity, one relaxed and one braced, while each PMHS was exposed to one impulse at each severity. Linear acceleration and angular velocity of the head were measured at a sampling rate of 20kHz, then filtered using SAE Channel Frequency Class 180 and 60, respectively, and transformed to the head center of gravity (CG). The location of the head CG, external auditory meatus, and occipital condyle (OC) were approximated using pretest photos and literature values. Neck forces (Fx and Fz) and sagittal plane moments (My) were calculated at the OC by applying the equations of dynamic equilibrium to the head.Results: Peak Fx, Fz, and My increased significantly with increasing acceleration severity (p {$<$} 0.1). Minimal differences were observed between the magnitudes of the peak forces and moments for each subject type. Qualitatively, differences in the timing of peak neck forces and moments and the overall shape of the time histories were evident. Maximum Fx, Fz, and My occurred earliest in the event for the braced volunteers and latest for the PMHSs. However, these differences were not supported statistically for the volunteers (p {$>$} 0.05). The timing of neck loading was visibly augmented by the increased stiffness of the volunteer necks as a result of muscle activation. Although differences were observed between the volunteer muscle conditions, the volunteer subsets were more similar to each other than the PMHSs.Conclusions: This study examined the effects of active muscles, in the form of conscious and reflexive muscle activity, on the biomechanical response of occupants in low-speed frontal sled tests. Although active bracing did not result in significantly different peak neck loads or moments, the timing of these peak values were affected by muscle condition. The findings of this study provide insight to the kinetics experienced during low-speed sled tests and are important to consider when refining and validating computational models and ATDs used to assess injury risk in automotive collisions.},

In October 1997, Sweden reached an important milestone when the Swedish Parliament adopted Vision Zero as their new long-term goal and strategy for road safety. How Swedish society has responded to this public health problem and how it has evolved over the years forms the subject matter of this presentation. Vision Zero as a policy innovation and how it influences both Sweden's road safety strategies and the operational road safety work and its results will be a useful example to other countries and societies looking for a sustainable answer.},

  abstract = {A point cloud is a set of points defined in a 3D metric space. Point clouds have become one of the most significant data formats for 3D representation and are gaining increased popularity as a result of the increased availability of acquisition devices, as well as seeing increased application in areas such as robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented and virtual reality. Deep learning is now the most powerful tool for data processing in computer vision and is becoming the most preferred technique for tasks such as classification, segmentation, and detection. While deep learning techniques are mainly applied to data with a structured grid, the point cloud, on the other hand, is unstructured. The unstructuredness of point clouds makes the use of deep learning for its direct processing very challenging. This paper contains a review of the recent state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, mainly focusing on raw point cloud data. The initial work on deep learning directly with raw point cloud data did not model local regions; therefore, subsequent approaches model local regions through sampling and grouping. More recently, several approaches have been proposed that not only model the local regions but also explore the correlation between points in the local regions. From the survey, we conclude that approaches that model local regions and take into account the correlation between points in the local regions perform better. Contrary to existing reviews, this paper provides a general structure for learning with raw point clouds, and various methods were compared based on the general structure. This work also introduces the popular 3D point cloud benchmark datasets and discusses the application of deep learning in popular 3D vision tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection.},

  abstract = {Osteoporosis is a common bone disease that occurs when the creation of new bone does not keep up with the loss of old bone, resulting in increased fracture risk. Adults over the age of 50 are especially at risk and see their quality of life diminished because of limited mobility, which can lead to isolation and depression. We are developing a robust screening method capable of identifying individuals predisposed to hip fracture to address this clinical challenge. The method uses finite element analysis and relies on segmented computed tomography (CT) images of the hip. Presently, the segmentation of the proximal femur requires manual input, which is a tedious task, prone to human error, and severely limits the practicality of the method in a clinical context. Here we present a novel approach for segmenting the proximal femur that uses a deep convolutional neural network to produce accurate, automated, robust, and fast segmentations of the femur from CT scans. The network architecture is based on the renowned u-net, which consists of a downsampling path to extract increasingly complex features of the input patch and an upsampling path to convert the acquired low resolution image into a high resolution one. Skipped connections allow us to recover critical spatial information lost during downsampling. The model was trained on 30 manually segmented CT images and was evaluated on 200 ground truth manual segmentations. Our method delivers a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) of 0.990 and 0.981 mm, respectively.},

In exploring ten topical road safety issues, this lecture takes a discursive, speculative approach to lay out a broader, overlapping set of entry points for considering traffic safety and its delivery, to minimize the masking of key issues often embedded in others and possibly lost in the immediate conversation. For each issue, questions are posed to help set an agenda for ongoing dialogue and research. In exploring these issues and questions arising, we can more realistically face the challenges ahead and commit to long-term action and success. We can both know more and do more with what we know.},

Full scale tests were performed with the side impact dummy SID-IIs at two different crash severities, with and without SAB in a midsize passenger car., Field data showed that of all AIS3+ injured restrained occupants 13 years and older, 59\% had AIS3+ thoracic injuries and 38\% had AIS3+ head injuries. The thoracic injuries were distributed to lungs (60\%), skeletal fractures (38\%) and injuries to arteries (1,26\%) and heart (0,1\%). For AIS3+ injured children, age 4\textendash 12, 51\% had AIS3+ thoracic injuries and 54\% had AIS3+ head injuries. Compared to adults, children sustained less fractures and more lung injuries. The rear side interior was the main injury source regardless of age group., In the full scale tests, the thoracic side-airbag reduced the average rib deflection by 50\% and resulted in an AIS3+ injury risk reduction from 36\% to 3\%. At the higher impact speed, SAB reduced the injury risk from 93\% to 24\%., The full scale crash tests showed that SAB offer a significant potential for thoracic injury reduction in the crash severities causing the majority of serious injuries in real life crashes.},

The development of effective safety technologies to protect all occupants requires high quality data from a range of biomechanical test subjects representative of the population at risk. Here we sought to quantify the demographic characteristics of the volunteers and post-mortem human subjects (PMHSs) used to create the available biomechanical data for the human neck during automotive impacts. A systematic literature and database search was conducted to identify kinematic data that could be used to characterize the neck response to inertial loading or direct head/body impacts. We compiled the sex, age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) for 999 volunteers and 110 PMHSs exposed to 5,431 impacts extracted from 63 published studies and three databases, and then compared the distributions of these parameters to reference data drawn from the neck-injured, fatally-injured, and general populations. We found that the neck biomechanical data were biased toward males, the volunteer data were younger, and the PMHS data were older than the reference populations. Other smaller biases were also noted, particularly within female distributions, in the height, weight, and BMI distributions relative to the neck-injured populations. It is vital to increase the diversity of volunteer and cadaveric test subjects in future studies in order to fill the gaps in the current neck biomechanical data. This increased diversity will provide critical data to address existing inequities in automotive and other safety technologies.}

In this study, dynamic compressive mechanical properties of the human skull have been determined. These properties are suitable for incorporation in an FEM of the skull with a coarse mesh (\textasciitilde{} 5 mm) affording greater computational efficiency. Cylindrical through-the-thickness specimens (cores) of skull bone were obtained from ten regions of the right calvarium of ten male post-mortem human surrogates. Potted specimens were compressed using a ramp displacement. The resulting stress vs. strain behavior was used to calculate effective material properties of the skull cores. A micro computed tomography ({$\mu$}CT) study of the cores was performed prior to testing to determine response dependency on microstructure. The modulus of elasticity was determined as 450 {$\pm$} 135 MPa and the failure stress was estimated as 23 {$\pm$} 6 MPa. These material properties did not correlate with harvest location or average apparent density in the cores. This study characterizes the combined response of the inner and outer tables and the diploe and provides dynamic material properties to be used in an FEM suitable for high strain rate applications.},

  abstract = {The human calvarium is a sandwich structure with two dense layers of cortical bone separated by porous cancellous bone. The variation of the three dimensional geometry, including the layer thicknesses and the volume fraction of the cancellous layer across the population, is unavailable in the current literature. This information is of particular importance to mathematical models of the human head used to simulate mechanical response. Although the target geometry for these models is the median geometry of the population, the best attempt so far has been the scaling of a unique geometry based on a few median anthropometric measurements of the head. However, this method does not represent the median geometry. This paper reports the average three dimensional geometry of the calvarium from X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging and layer thickness and trabecular volume fraction from micro CT ({$\mu$}CT) imaging of ten adult male post-mortem human surrogates (PMHS). Skull bone samples have been obtained and {$\mu$}CT imaging was done at a resolution of 30{$\mu$}m. Monte Carlo simulation was done to estimate the variance in these measurements due to the uncertainty in image segmentation. The layer thickness data has been averaged over areas of 5mm2. The outer cortical layer was found to be significantly (p{$<$}0.01; Student's t test) thicker than the inner layer (median of thickness ratio 1.68). Although there was significant location to location difference in all the layer thicknesses and volume fraction measurements, there was no trend. Average distribution and the variance of these metrics on the calvarium have been shown. The findings have been reported as colormaps on a 2D projection of the cranial vault.},

We performed a retrospective cohort study with national crash data between 1998 and 2008 to determine the role of driver sex as a predictor of injury outcome when involved in a crash., Results. The odds for a belt-restrained female driver to sustain severe injuries were 47\% (95\% confidence interval = 28\%, 70\%) higher than those for a belt-restrained male driver involved in a comparable crash., Conclusions. To address the sex-specific disparity demonstrated in this study, health policies and vehicle regulations must focus on effective safety designs specifically tailored toward the female population for equity in injury reduction.},

  abstract = {Objective Advanced occupant protection systems in motor-vehicles (e.g., seat belts and airbags), while widely adopted for front-seat passengers, are either absent or offer disproportionally lower safety to rear-seat passengers in similar crashes. Optimization of advanced restraint systems for the rear-seat environment will require a detailed understanding of epidemiology and associated risk factors for injuries sustained by rear-seat passengers. Thus, the objective of the study is to use national level motor-vehicle travel and crash data to quantify rear-seat travel exposure, and determine the descriptive characteristics and the injury outcomes for rear-seat passengers involved in frontal collisions. Methods While U.S. travel data from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey was used to determine rear-seat travel estimates, crash data from 2001 to 2010 National Automotive Sampling System Crash Worthiness Data System was used to enroll rear-seat passengers injured in a frontal crash. The descriptive epidemiology of rear-seat crash victims was separately done for the three age-groups: children (8\textendash 15 years old), adults (16\textendash 59 years old), and senior adults (60+). Results The study indicated that senior adults in rear-seats were associated with a significantly higher rate of sustaining fatal (6\%) and severe injuries (16\% for MAIS 3+ injuries) in comparison to the younger cohorts. The distribution of severe injuries further indicated that the thorax was the most frequently injured region across all age groups irrespective of the belt-use status. Conclusions Findings of the study conclude that while rear-seat travel in the U.S. is still very low and improving belt usage is a primary concern among rear-seat passengers; however, the epidemiology supports the need for adapting rear-seat restraint performance for effective protection for all groups of rear-seat passengers.},

Another aim of the study was to investigate pressure phenomena and ganglion injuries at static neck extension loading and dynamic neck extension trauma with a head-restraint present. Experiments on pigs were conducted. Preliminary results indicate that ganglion injuries, as well as pressure transients inside the spinal canal, seem to correlate to the phase shift when the neck passes an s-shape (or maximal retraction) during the rearward motion of the head. That is, when the upper neck quickly changes from a flexion to an extension shape. Static loading of the neck resulted in no signs of injuries to the ganglia. A possible candidate for a neck injury criterion is presented, based on the relative acceleration between the top and the bottom of the cervical spine.

  abstract = {In order to be globally deployed, autonomous cars must guarantee the safety of pedestrians. This is the reason why forecasting pedestrians' intentions sufficiently in advance is one of the most critical and challenging tasks for autonomous vehicles. This work tries to solve this problem by jointly predicting the intention and visual states of pedestrians. In terms of visual states, whereas previous work focused on x-y coordinates, we will also predict the size and indeed the whole bounding box of the pedestrian. The method is a recurrent neural network in a multi-task learning approach. It has one head that predicts the intention of the pedestrian for each one of its future position and another one predicting the visual states of the pedestrian. Experiments on the JAAD dataset show the superiority of the performance of our method compared to previous works for intention prediction. Also, although its simple architecture (more than 2 times faster), the performance of the bounding box prediction is comparable to the ones yielded by much more complex architectures. Our code is available online.},

A series of tests was conducted with a horizontal steel bar impactor. Two energy levels used were intended to be without bone fracture and to cause bone fracture for two impacted areas: the thorax at the mid-sternum in frontal impact or subaxillary in lateral impact, and the pelvis at the H point in lateral impact. Before the tests, each subject was instrumented. Three mounting plates for tri-axial accelerometer were screwed to the lumbar spine at D1, D12 and at the sacrum. Three small balls were installed on each accelerometer to serve as reference points in the three-dimensional analysis with the films from three high speed cameras. The impactor acceleration and the impactor forces were recorded. After each impact, the subject was examined, photographed, and positioned to the next impact. After the final impact, the subject was removed for autopsy to determine the injuries. (A) For the covering abstract of the conference see IRRD 894848.},

  abstract = {Objective Use volunteer data and parametric finite element (FE) human body models to investigate how restraint systems can be designed to adapt to a diverse population and pre-crash posture changes induced by active safety features.Methods Four FE human models were generated by morphing the midsize male GHBMC simplified model into geometries representing a midsize male, midsize female, short obese female (BMI 40 kg/m2), and large obese male (BMI 40 kg/m2) based on statistical skeleton and body shape geometry models. Each human model was positioned in a generic vehicle driver environment using two occupant pre-crash postures based on volunteer test results including one resulting from 1-g abrupt braking events. Improved restraint designs were manually developed for each occupant model in a 56 km/h frontal crash condition by adding a knee airbag, adjusting the shoulder belt load limit, steering column force, and driver airbag properties (tethers, inflation, and vent size). The improved designs were then tested at both pre-crash postures. Injury risks for the head, neck, chest, and lower extremities were analyzed.Results Human size and shape dominated the occupant injury measures, while the pre-crash-braking induced posture had minimal effects. Some of the safety concerns observed for large occupants include head strike-through the airbag and a conflict between head and chest injuries, which were mitigated by a stiffer restraint system with properly-tuned driver airbag. Chest injuries were a prominent safety concern for female occupants, mitigated by a softer seatbelt and smaller airbag size near the chest. Obese occupants exhibited a higher likelihood of lower extremity injuries indicating a need for a knee airbag. A diverse set of improved restraint designs were effective in lowering injury risks, indicating that restraint adaptability is necessary for accounting for occupant diversity.Conclusions This study investigated the effects of occupant size and shape variability, posture, and restraint design on injury risk for high-speed frontal crashes. More forward initial postures due to active safety features may decrease head, neck, and lower extremity injury risk, but may also increase chest injury risk. Safety concerns observed for large occupants include head strike-through and a conflict between head and chest injuries. Obese occupants had higher knee-thigh-hip injury risk. New restraints that adapt to occupant size and body shape may improve crash safety for all occupants. Further investigation is needed to confirm and extend the findings of this study.},

Adequate application of anatomical knowledge is required to increase safety and efficacy of different minimally-invasive aesthetic procedures in this anatomical region. Objective To describe the layered anatomy of the forehead soft tissues with respect to their thicknesses and how they relate to different minimally-invasive aesthetic treatments. Methods A total of n = 85 healthy study participants (69 females and 16 males) with a mean age of 40.84 {$\pm$} 10.9 years and a mean body mass index of 22.65 {$\pm$} 2.6 kg/m2 were investigated with ultrasound-based imaging to measure the thickness of different forehead soft tissues. Results The mean overall soft tissue thickness of the forehead was measured to be 4.18 {$\pm$} 0.7 mm for the entire study population. Increasing BMI values correlated statistically significantly with increasing thickness of all measured forehead soft tissues with exception of the frontalis muscle. On a statistically significant level, males showed thicker forehead soft tissues than females, with exception of the retrofrontalis fat and the frontalis muscle. Conclusion On basis of the findings obtained in this study, basic treatment principles can be derived and improved for the injection of neuromodulators, hyaluronic acid as well as the application of polydiaxonane (PDO) threads and micro-focused ultrasound. Precise knowledge and thorough understanding of the layers and soft tissues of the forehead is required to guarantee safe and effective procedures in this aesthetically important facial region.},

The paper contributes an overview about research results on safety at roundabouts with a focus on urban intersections. Even if it is written from a German perspective, it includes results from several other countries. As a conclusion from all studies, there is no doubt that roundabouts are the safest type of intersection. Especially the single-lane roundabouts reveal the highest level of safety. Also mini-roundabouts have an extraordinary good safety record. Turbo-roundabouts\textemdash regarding safety\textemdash are on the same level as the single-laned. This high degree of traffic safety is strictly depending on the speed-reducing design of the whole intersection. In comparison to conventional types of intersections like signalized or two-way-stop intersections, the car occupants and the pedestrians enjoy the highest gains from roundabout safety. On the other hand, bicyclists can become a problem for traffic safety at roundabouts. However, also cyclists can be operated with a sufficient degree of safety\textemdash but only if the requirements for design are strictly obeyed. It should be emphasized that the high degree of safety is coherent to road user discipline and to the acceptance of the existing traffic rules. This acceptance should be strengthened by an adequate intersection design. Therefore, the favourable safety effects of roundabouts can only be achieved if the rules for modern roundabout design, as they are documented in many national design guidelines, are strictly applied.},

  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.},

This poetic definition comes from the great mathematician Hermann Weyl, credited with laying the foundation of our modern theory of the universe. Another great physicist, Philip Anderson, said that "it is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry." In mathematics, symmetry was crucial in the foundation of geometry as we know it in the 19th century. Now it could have a similar impact on another emerging field. Deep Learning success in recent decades is significant \textendash{} from revolutionising data science to landmark achievements in computer vision, board games, and protein folding. At the same time, a lack of unifying principles makes it is difficult to understand the relations between different neural network architectures resulting in the reinvention and re-branding of the same concepts.    Michael Bronstein is a professor at Imperial College London and Head of Graph ML Research at Twitter, who is working to bring geometric unification of deep learning through the lens of symmetry. In his ICLR 2021 keynote lecture, he presents a common mathematical framework to study the most successful network architectures, giving a constructive procedure to build future machine learning in a principled way that could be applied in new domains such as social science, biology, and drug design.

  abstract = {Objective: The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) introduced its side impact consumer information test program in 2003. Since that time, side airbags and structural improvements have been implemented across the fleet and the proportion of good ratings has increased to 93\% of 2012\textendash 2014 model year vehicles. Research has shown that drivers of good-rated vehicles are 70\% less likely to die in a left-side crash than drivers of poor-rated vehicles. Despite these improvements, side impact fatalities accounted for about one quarter of passenger vehicle occupant fatalities in 2012. This study is a detailed analysis of real-world cases with serious injury resulting from side crashes of vehicles with good ratings in the IIHS side impact test.Methods: NASS-CDS and Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) were queried for occupants of good-rated vehicles who sustained an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) {$\geq$} 3 injury in a side-impact crash. The resulting 110 cases were categorized by impact configuration and other factors that contributed to injury. Patterns of impact configuration, restraint performance, and occupant injury were identified and discussed in the context of potential upgrades to the current IIHS side impact test.Results: Three quarters of the injured occupants were involved in near-side impacts. For these occupants, the most common factors contributing to injury were crash severities greater than the IIHS test, inadequate side-airbag performance, and lack of side-airbag coverage for the injured body region. In the cases where an airbag was present but did not prevent the injury, occupants were often exposed to loading centered farther forward on the vehicle than in the IIHS test. Around 40\% of the far-side occupants were injured from contact with the struck-side interior structure, and almost all of these cases were more severe than the IIHS test. The remaining far-side occupants were mostly elderly and sustained injury from the center console, instrument panel, or seat belt. In addition, many far-side occupants were likely out of position due to events preceding the side impact and/or being unbelted.Conclusion: Individual changes to the IIHS side impact test have the potential to reduce the number of serious injuries in real-world crashes. These include impacting the vehicle farther forward (relevant to 28\% of all cases studied), greater test severity (17\%), the inclusion of far-side occupants (9\%), and more restrictive injury criteria (9\%). Combinations of these changes could be more effective.},

  abstract = {Objective Previous research has found elevated injury risk for females relative to males in passenger vehicle crashes but has not accounted for ways the crashes themselves differ between these populations. Vehicle curb weight, ride height, safety rating, airbag deployment, and crash configuration all influence injury outcome and often are not well-represented by delta-V alone. This study evaluated the effect of occupant sex on injury risk in front and side crashes while limiting or controlling for non-physiological crash differences. Additionally, the effects of crashworthiness improvements are compared for females and males.Methods NASS-CDS cases from 1998\textendash 2015 calendar years involving a belted driver in a front crash or a struck-side driver or right front passenger in a side crash were analyzed. Case vehicle model years were 1989\textendash 2016. Logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of MAIS {$\geq$} 2 and MAIS {$\geq$} 3 injury outcomes for females relative to males as well as the change in risk due to improved crashworthiness. Sex-based differences in occupant age, mass, and stature; crash test rating; delta-V; crash configuration; and vehicle-to-vehicle compatibility were considered either through case selection or the inclusion of additional regression covariates.Results Before controlling for crash and vehicle differences, female drivers in front crashes had higher estimated overall and body-region-specific risks of MAIS {$\geq$} 2 and MAIS {$\geq$} 3 injury, as consistent with previous findings. After accounting for such differences, all ratios of injury odds for females relative to males were reduced. Females remained at higher risk of MAIS {$\geq$} 2 injury (OR, 2.23; 95\% CI, 1.42\textendash 3.51), especially extremity injury, but had similar odds for MAIS {$\geq$} 3 non-extremity injury (OR, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.56\textendash 1.7). While controlling for crash differences in side impacts, none of the estimated injury risk differences by sex were significant at the p {$\leq$} 0.05 level. Estimated benefits of improved crashworthiness were similar or greater for females than for males for most injury outcomes.Conclusions Female-specific crashworthiness improvements may be required to provide additional protection against AIS 2 extremity injury. Much of the remaining discrepancy in sex-based injury risk can be attributed differences between vehicles and crashes, not to physiological differences. Addressing these differences will require other types of countermeasures.},

  abstract = {Pelvic fractures have been identified as the second most common AIS2+ injury in motor vehicle crashes, with the highest early mortality rate compared to other orthopaedic injuries. Further, the risk is associated with occupant sex, age, stature and body mass index (BMI). In this study, clinical pelvic CT scans from 132 adults (75 females, 57 males) were extracted from a patient database. The population shape variance in pelvis bone geometry was studied by Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) and a morphometric model was developed by multivariate linear regression using overall anthropometric variables (sex, age, stature, BMI). In the analysis, SPCA identified 15 principal components (PCs) describing 83.6\% of the shape variations. Eight of these were significantly captured ({$\alpha~<~$}0.05) by the morphometric model, which predicted 29\% of the total variance in pelvis geometry. The overall anthropometric variables were significantly related to geometrical features primarily in the inferior-anterior regions while being unable to significantly capture local sacrum features, shape and position of ASIS and lateral tilt of the iliac wings. In conclusion, a new detailed morphometric model of the pelvis bone demonstrated that overall anthropometric variables account for only 29\% of the variance in pelvis geometry. Furthermore, variations in the superior-anterior region of the pelvis, with which the lap belt is intended to interact, were not captured. Depending on the scenario, shape variations not captured by overall anthropometry could have important implications for injury prediction in traffic safety analysis.},

  abstract = {Mechanics are increasingly recognized to play an important role in modulating brain form and function. Computational simulations are a powerful tool to predict the mechanical behavior of the human brain in health and disease. The success of these simulations depends critically on the underlying constitutive model and on the reliable identification of its material parameters. Thus, there is an urgent need to thoroughly characterize the mechanical behavior of brain tissue and to identify mathematical models that capture the tissue response under arbitrary loading conditions. However, most constitutive models have only been calibrated for a single loading mode. Here, we perform a sequence of multiple loading modes on the same human brain specimen \textendash{} simple shear in two orthogonal directions, compression, and tension \textendash{} and characterize the loading-mode specific regional and directional behavior. We complement these three individual tests by combined multiaxial compression/tension-shear tests and discuss effects of conditioning and hysteresis. To explore to which extent the macrostructural response is a result of the underlying microstructural architecture, we supplement our biomechanical tests with diffusion tensor imaging and histology. We show that the heterogeneous microstructure leads to a regional but not directional dependence of the mechanical properties. Our experiments confirm that human brain tissue is nonlinear and viscoelastic, with a pronounced compression-tension asymmetry. Using our measurements, we compare the performance of five common constitutive models, neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Demiray, Gent, and Ogden, and show that only the isotropic modified one-term Ogden model is capable of representing the hyperelastic behavior under combined shear, compression, and tension loadings: with a shear modulus of 0.4\textendash 1.4kPa and a negative nonlinearity parameter it captures the compression-tension asymmetry and the increase in shear stress under superimposed compression but not tension. Our results demonstrate that material parameters identified for a single loading mode fail to predict the response under arbitrary loading conditions. Our systematic characterization of human brain tissue will lead to more accurate computational simulations, which will allow us to determine criteria for injury, to develop smart protection systems, and to predict brain development and disease progression. Statement of Significance There is a pressing need to characterize the mechanical behavior of human brain tissue under multiple loading conditions, and to identify constitutive models that are able to capture the tissue response under these conditions. We perform a sequence of experimental tests on the same brain specimen to characterize the regional and directional behavior, and we supplement our tests with DTI and histology to explore to which extent the macrostructural response is a result of the underlying microstructure. Results demonstrate that human brain tissue is nonlinear and viscoelastic, with a pronounced compression-tension asymmetry, and we show that the multiaxial data can best be captured by a modified version of the one-term Ogden model.},

  abstract = {Brain tissue is not only one of~the most important but also the most complex and compliant tissue in the human body. While long underestimated, increasing evidence confirms that mechanics plays a critical role in modulating brain function and dysfunction. Computational simulations\textendash based on the field equations of nonlinear continuum mechanics\textendash can provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms of brain injury and disease that go beyond the possibilities of traditional diagnostic tools. Realistic numerical predictions, however, require mechanical models that are capable of capturing the complex and unique characteristics of this ultrasoft, heterogeneous, and active tissue. In recent years, contradictory experimental results have caused confusion and hindered rapid progress. In this review, we carefully assess the challenges associated with brain tissue testing and modeling, and work out the most important characteristics of brain tissue behavior on different length and time scales. Depending on the application of interest, we propose appropriate mechanical modeling approaches that are as complex as necessary but as simple as possible. This comprehensive review will, on the one hand, stimulate the design of new experiments and, on the other hand, guide the selection of appropriate constitutive models for specific applications. Mechanical models that capture the complex behavior of nervous tissues and are accurately calibrated with reliable and comprehensive experimental data are key to performing reliable predictive simulations. Ultimately, mathematical modeling and computational simulations of the brain are useful for both biomedical and clinical communities, and cover a wide range of applications ranging from predicting disease progression and estimating injury risk to planning surgical procedures.},

Good modelling requires its users and commissioners to understand more about the whole process, including the different kinds of purpose a model can have and the different technical bases. This paper offers a guide to the process of commissioning, developing and deploying models across a wide range of domains from public policy to science and engineering. It provides two checklists to help potential modellers, commissioners and users ensure they have considered the most significant factors that will determine success. We conclude there is a need to reinforce modelling as a discipline, so that misconstruction is less likely; to increase understanding of modelling in all domains, so that the misuse of models is reduced; and to bring commissioners closer to modelling, so that the results are more useful.},

The model consisted of rigid vertebrae interconnected by assemblies of nonlinear springs and dashpots, and a finite element shell model of the skull. Quasi-static flexion-extension characteristics of ten human cadaveric cervical spines were measured using a test frame capable of applying pure moments. The cadaveric motion segments demonstrated a nonlinear stiffening response without a no-load neutral zone. Computational model parameters were based upon these measurements and existing data reported in the literature. Geometric and inertial characteristics were derived from three-dimensional reconstructions of skull and vertebral CT images. The model reproduced the shape and timing of the cervical spine buckling deformations observed in high speed video of cadaveric studies of near-vert ex head impact [1]. Head and neck force histories and head acceleration histories agreed with those reported in the cadaveric studies. A sensitivity analysis of the model parameters revealed that head and neck responses were most sensitive to changes in head stiffness, head mass, and flexion-extension properties, suggesting that an appropriately configured deformable head and accurate experimental characterization of motion segment flexion-extension behavior are critical to reliable model predictions. This validated, computationally efficient model is well suited for large-scale parametric studies of the role of impact surface properties on injury risk. It also serves as a foundation for future model enhancements such as the incorporation of the cervical musculature.},

Articulating approaches that practitioners use to address equity in their work, including experience-based strategies and research-developed equity metrics, contribute to supporting the achievement of transportation equity goals. However, a gap exists between knowing these approaches and integrating them into regular professional practice, in part because of barriers that span across different transportation-related contexts. To investigate practitioners' approaches to transportation equity, as well as barriers they encounter in trying to achieve improved equity, interviews were conducted with 59 transportation practitioners from the public, private, non-profit, and academic sectors. Findings revealed that a majority of the transportation practitioners in the study engaged in addressing equity in their work, including through collaborating with other organizations and sectors, integrating non-transportation-related data, and considering the contextual needs of vulnerable communities. They identified key barriers to their implementation of transportation equity approaches, including the lack of sufficient and quality equity-related data, challenges with accessing and collecting data, and a lack of standards and metrics for measuring equity-related outcomes. These findings can guide work that supports the explicit integration of transportation equity approaches into practitioners' practices.},

The successful prior use of craniometric landmarks makes extrapolation of these landmarks to the soft tissue context, as analogs, intuitive for forensic craniofacial analyses and facial photogrammetry. However, this extrapolation has not, so far, been systematic. Instead, varied nomenclature and definitions exist for facial landmarks, and photographic analyses are complicated by the generalization of 3D craniometric landmarks to the 2D face space where analogy is subsequently often lost, complicating anatomical assessments. For example, landmarks requiring palpation of the skull or the examination of the 3D surface typology are impossible to legitimately position; similar applies to median landmarks not visible in lateral photographs. To redress these issues without disposing of the craniometric framework that underpins many facial landmarks, we provide an updated and transparent nomenclature for facial description. This nomenclature maintains the original craniometric intent (and base abbreviations) but provides clear distinction of ill-defined (quasi) landmarks in photographic contexts, as produced when anatomical points are subjectively inferred from shape-from-shading information alone.},

Hence, there is a need for improved tools to address female WAD prevention when developing and evaluating the performance of whiplash protection systems. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a finite element model of a 50th percentile female rear impact crash test dummy.Methods: The anthropometry of the 50th percentile female was specified based on literature data. The model, called EvaRID (female rear impact dummy), was based on the same design concept as the existing 50th percentile male rear impact dummy, the BioRID II. A scaling approach was developed and the first version, EvaRID V1.0, was implemented. Its dynamic response was compared to female volunteer data from rear impact sled tests.Results: The EvaRID V1.0 model and the volunteer tests compared well until {$\sim$}250 ms of the head and T1 forward accelerations and rearward linear displacements and of the head rearward angular displacement. Markedly less T1 rearward angular displacement was found for the EvaRID model compared to the female volunteers. Similar results were received for the BioRID II model when comparing simulated responses with experimental data under volunteer loading conditions. The results indicate that the biofidelity of the EvaRID V1.0 and BioRID II FE models have limitations, predominantly in the T1 rearward angular displacement, at low velocity changes (7 km/h). The BioRID II model was validated against dummy test results in a loading range close to consumer test conditions (EuroNCAP) and lower severity levels of volunteer testing were not considered.Conclusions: The EvaRID dummy model demonstrated the potential of becoming a valuable tool when evaluating and developing seats and whiplash protection systems. However, updates of the joint stiffness will be required to provide better correlation at lower load levels. Moreover, the seated posture, curvature of the spine, and head position of 50th percentile female occupants needs to be established and implemented in future models.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to present the design of a prototype rear impact crash test dummy, representing a 50th percentile female, and compare its performance to volunteer response data. The intention was to develop a first crude prototype as a first step towards a future biofidelic 50th percentile female rear impact dummy. The current rear impact crash test dummy, BioRID II, represents a 50th percentile male, which may limit the assessment and development of whiplash protection systems with regard to female occupants. Introduction of this new dummy size will facilitate evaluation of seat and head restraint (HR) responses in both the average sized female and male in rear impacts. A 50th percentile female rear impact prototype dummy, the BioRID P50F, was developed from modified body segments originating from the BioRID II. The mass and rough dimensions of the BioRID P50F is representative of a 50th percentile female. The prototype dummy was evaluated against low severity rear impact sled tests comprising six female volunteers closely resembling a 50th percentile female with regard to stature and mass. The head/neck response of the BioRID P50F prototype resembled the female volunteer response corridors. The stiffness of the thoracic and lumbar spinal joints remained the same as the average sized male BioRID II, and therefore likely stiffer than joints of an average female. Consequently, the peak rearward angular displacement of the head and T1, and the rearward displacement of the T1, were lesser for the BioRID P50F in comparison to the female volunteers. The biofidelity of the BioRID P50F prototype thus has some limitations. Based on a seat response comparison between the BioRID P50F and the BioRID II, it can be concluded that the male BioRID II is an insufficient representation of the average female in the assessment of the dynamic seat response and effectiveness of whiplash protection systems.},

Objective To perform a best evidence synthesis on the course and prognostic factors for neck pain and its associated disorders in Grades I\textendash III whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). Summary of Background Data Knowledge of the course of recovery of WAD guides expectations for recovery. Identifying prognostic factors assists in planning management and intervention strategies and effective compensation policies to decrease the burden of WAD. Methods The Bone and Joint Decade 2000\textendash 2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and its Associated Disorders (Neck Pain Task Force) conducted a critical review of the literature published between 1980 and 2006 to assemble the best evidence on neck pain and its associated disorders. Studies meeting criteria for scientific validity were included in a best evidence synthesis. Results We found 226 articles related to course and prognostic factors in neck pain and its associated disorders. After a critical review, 70 (31\%) were accepted on scientific merit; 47 of these studies related to course and prognostic factors in WAD. The evidence suggests that approximately 50\% of those with WAD will report neck pain symptoms 1 year after their injuries. Greater initial pain, more symptoms, and greater initial disability predicted slower recovery. Few factors related to the collision itself (for example, direction of the collision, headrest type) were prognostic; however, postinjury psychological factors such as passive coping style, depressed mood, and fear of movement were prognostic for slower or less complete recovery. There is also preliminary evidence that the prevailing compensation system is prognostic for recovery in WAD. Conclusion The Neck Pain Task Force undertook a best evidence synthesis to establish a baseline of the current best evidence on the course and prognosis for WAD. Recovery of WAD seems to be multifactorial.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effects of age, body mass index (BMI) and gender on motor vehicle crash (MVC) injuries are not well understood and current prevention efforts do not effectively address variability in occupant characteristics. OBJECTIVES: (1) Characterize the effects of age, BMI and gender on serious-to-fatal MVC injury. (2) Identify the crash modes and body regions where the effects of occupant characteristics on the numbers of occupants with injury is largest, and thereby aid in prioritizing the need for human surrogates that represent different types of occupant characteristics and adaptive restraint systems that consider these characteristics. METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the effects of occupant characteristics (age, BMI, gender), vehicle and crash characteristics on serious-to-fatal injuries (AIS 3+) by body region and crash mode using the 2000-2010 National Automotive Sampling System (NASS-CDS) dataset. Logistic regression models were applied to weighted crash data to estimate the change in the number of annual injured occupants with AIS 3+ injury that would occur if occupant characteristics were limited to their 5th percentiles (age{$\leq$}17 years old, BMI{$\leq$}19kg/m(2)) or male gender. RESULTS: Limiting age was associated with a decrease in the total number of occupants with head [8396, 95\% CI 6871-9070] and thorax injuries [17,961, 95\% CI 15,960-18,859] across all crash modes, decreased occupants with spine [3843, 95\% CI 3065-4242] and upper extremity [3578, 95\% CI 1402-4439] injuries in frontal and rollover crashes and decreased abdominal [1368, 95\% CI 1062-1417] and lower extremity [4584, 95\% CI 4012-4995] injuries in frontal impacts. The age effect was modulated by gender with older females more likely to have thorax and upper extremity injuries than older males. Limiting BMI was associated with 2069 [95\% CI 1107-2775] fewer thorax injuries in nearside crashes, and 5304 [95\% CI 4279-5688] fewer lower extremity injuries in frontal crashes. Setting gender to male resulted in fewer occupants with head injuries in farside crashes [1999, 95\% CI 844-2685] and fewer thorax [5618, 95\% CI 4212-6272], upper [3804, 95\% CI 1781-4803] and lower extremity [2791, 95\% CI 2216-3256] injuries in frontal crashes. Results indicate that age provides the greater relative contribution to injury when compared to gender and BMI, especially for thorax and head injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Restraint systems that account for the differential injury risks associated with age, BMI and gender could have a meaningful effect on injury in motor-vehicle crashes. Computational models of humans that represent older, high BMI, and female occupants are needed for use in simulations of particular types of crashes to develop these restraint systems.},

In the proposed algorithm, a deep neural network including recurrent layers is trained on measured or simulated marker trajectories. Labels are assigned to markers using the Hungarian algorithm and a predefined generic marker set is used to identify and correct mislabeled markers. The algorithm was first trained and tested on measured motion capture data. Then, the algorithm was trained on simulated trajectories and tested on data that included movements not contained in the simulated data set. The ability to improve accuracy using transfer learning to update the neural network weights based on labelled motion capture data was assessed. The effect of occluded and extraneous markers on labelling accuracy was also examined. Labelling accuracy was 99.6\% when trained on measured data and 92.8\% when trained on simulated trajectories, but could be improved to up to 98.8\% through transfer learning. Missing or extraneous markers reduced labelling accuracy, but results were comparable to commercial software. The proposed labelling algorithm can be used to accurately label motion capture data in the presence of missing and extraneous markers and accuracy can be improved as data are collected, labelled, and added to the training set. The algorithm and user interface can reduce the time and manual effort required to label optical motion capture data, particularly for those with limited access to commercial software.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Purpose Current motor vehicle safety systems primarily focus on preventing life-threatening and serious injury during crashes, but occupants may still sustain less serious injury. Upper extremity injury is common in occupants involved in motor vehicle crashes. The purpose of this study was to compare occupants with scapula fractures to occupants with other shoulder injuries. Methods We used data from the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) database (1997\textendash 2008) to compare two groups of occupants: (1) occupants with only scapula fractures and (2) occupants with shoulder injury not involving the scapula. We hypothesised that there were no differences in demographics, vehicle, crash characteristics and causes of shoulder injury in these two groups. Results Of the 3370 occupants studied, 54 occupants (1.6\%) had only a scapula fracture in the shoulder region and 342 (10.1\%) occupants had other shoulder injuries. There were significant differences between gender, height and weight, maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) severity and the crash type. Occupants with scapula fractures were 3 times more likely to be male (odds ratio (OR)=3.30) and were significantly taller and weighed more than occupants with other shoulder injuries. Occupants with other shoulder injuries had significantly greater injury severity (based on maximum AIS for any injury) than those with scapula fractures. There was a significant difference between scapula fractures and clavicle fractures (OR=1.87) and joint dislocations/separations (OR=2.79) comparing the cause of injury (vehicle side interior vs. other causes). Safety belts are the single most important safety system in motor vehicles and should always be worn. However, we found no differences in the cause of scapula fractures comparing occupants wearing their safety belt with those not wearing the belt. Conclusion This study provides information showing that scapula fractures occur during different types of impacts and have different causes other than shoulder injuries.},

Different impact force and acceleration signal shapes were obtained depending on impact directions. In terms of deflection, an average of 30 mm and 60 mm of maximum shoulder deflections were measured respectively for non-injurious and injurious impacts.

In addition, previous tests carried out in similar conditions were re-analysed (5 thoracic impacts at 3.3 m/s, 5 others at 5.5 m/s and 10 pelvic impacts at 6.6 m/s). Impactor force, subject accelerations at T1, T4, T8, T12 and sacrum were recorded, while 2D motion of the subject's spine was filmed.

  abstract = {Finite element human neck models (NMs) aim to predict neck response and injury at the tissue level; however, contemporary models are most often assessed using global response such as head kinematics. Additionally, many NMs are developed from subject-specific imaging with limited soft tissue resolution in small structures such as the facet joints in the neck. Such details may be critical to enable NMs to predict tissue-level response. In the present study, the capsular joint cartilage (CJC) geometry in a contemporary NM was enhanced (M50-CJC) based on literature data. The M50-CJC was validated at the segment and full neck levels and assessed using relative facet joint kinematics (FJK), capsular ligament (CL) and intervertebral disc (IVD) strains, a relative vertebral rotation assessment (IV-NIC) and head kinematics in frontal and rear impact. The validation ratings at the segment level increased from 0.60 to 0.64, with improvements for modes of deformation associated with the facet joints, while no difference was noted at the head kinematic level. The improved CJC led to increased FJK rotation (188\%) and IVD strain (152.2\%,) attributed to the reduced facet joint gap. Further enhancements of the capsular joint representation or a link between the FJK and CL injury risk are recommended. Enhancements at the tissue level demonstrated a large effect on the IVD strain, but were not apparent in global metrics such as head kinematics. This study demonstrated that a biofidelic and detailed geometrical representation of the CJC contributes significantly to the predicted joint response, which is critical to investigate neck injury risk at the tissue level.},

  abstract = {The increased incidence of injury demonstrated in epidemiological data for the elderly population, and females compared to males, has not been fully understood in the context of the biomechanical response to impact. A contributing factor to these differences in injury risk could be the variation in geometry between young and aged persons and between males and females. In this study, a new methodology, coupling a CAD and a repositioning software, was developed to reposture an existing Finite element neck while retaining a high level of mesh quality. A 5th percentile female aged neck model (F0575YO) and a 50th percentile male aged neck model (M5075YO) were developed from existing young (F0526YO and M5026YO) neck models (Global Human Body Models Consortium v5.1). The aged neck models included an increased cervical lordosis and an increase in the facet joint angles, as reported in the literature. The young and the aged models were simulated in frontal (2, 8, and 15~g) and rear (3, 7, and 10~g) impacts. The responses were compared using head and relative facet joint kinematics, and nominal intervertebral disc shear strain. In general, the aged models predicted higher tissue deformations, although the head kinematics were similar for all models. In the frontal impact, only the M5075YO model predicted hard tissue failure, attributed to the combined effect of the more anteriorly located head with age, when compared to the M5026YO, and greater neck length relative to the female models. In the rear impacts, the F0575YO model predicted higher relative facet joint shear compared to the F0526YO, and higher relative facet joint rotation and nominal intervertebral disc strain compared to the M5075YO. When comparing the male models, the relative facet joint kinematics predicted by the M5026YO and M5075YO were similar. The contrast in response between the male and female models in the rear impacts was attributed to the higher lordosis and facet angle in females compared to males. Epidemiological data reported that females were more likely to sustain Whiplash Associated Disorders in rear impacts compared to males, and that injury risk increases with age, in agreement with the findings in the present study. This study demonstrated that, although the increased lordosis and facet angle did not affect the head kinematics, changes at the tissue level were considerable (e.g., 26\% higher relative facet shear in the female neck compared to the male, for rear impact) and relatable to the epidemiology. Future work will investigate tissue damage and failure through the incorporation of aged material properties and muscle activation.}

  abstract = {Active neck musculature plays an important role in the response of the head and neck during impact and can affect the risk of injury. Finite element Human Body Models (HBM) have been proposed with open and closed-loop controllers for activation of muscle forces; however, controllers are often calibrated to specific experimental loading cases, without considering the intrinsic role of physiologic muscle reflex mechanisms under different loading conditions. This study aimed to develop a single closed-loop controller for neck muscle activation in a contemporary male HBM based on known reflex mechanisms and assess how this approach compared to current open-loop controllers across a range of impact directions and severities. Controller parameters were optimized using volunteer data and independently assessed across twelve impact conditions. The kinematics from the closed-loop controller simulations showed good average CORA rating to the experimental data (0.699) for the impacts following the ISO/TR9790 standard. Compared to previously optimized open-loop activation strategy, the average difference was less than 9\%. The incorporation of the reflex mechanisms using a closed-loop controller can provide robust performance for a range of impact directions and severities, which is critical to improving HBM response under a larger spectrum of automotive impact simulations.},

Imaging techniques such as CT or MRI are typically used to generate anatomically correct model geometry. Accurate biological material properties and constitutive models present a challenge since tissues are typically anisotropic with nonlinear viscoelastic behavior and must be represented using a continuum approach. Verification and validation is a crucial development step to demonstrate the biofidelity of the model against experimental studies and is differentiated from model calibration, which involves adjusting FE modeling parameters to improve the agreement between the model and experimental data. Validation of the model should be performed in a continuous stepwise process, with increasing levels of complexity. Evaluating a numerical model against a variety of different loading conditions is the best means to obtain a fully validated model and this should be considered as a continuous process throughout the useful life of the model.},

These data are useful for the development and initialisation of computational human body models. A secondary aim was to examine the effect of reversible, motorised seat belts in these events. Kinematics were analysed for volunteers driving on rural roads, prior to autonomous braking (11 m/s2 deceleration). Two restraint configurations were tested: a standard versus a motorized belt, activated 200 ms before braking initiation. Kinematic metric comparison via ANCOVA was performed to understand postural differences across gender, role (driver/passenger), and belt type (standard/motorised). Data was analysed prior to and at vehicle deceleration, termed typical riding and initial braking, respectively. While males and females displayed similar postures during typical riding, differences existed between drivers and passengers, especially with respect to neck posture. Drivers displayed more protracted neck postures, with significantly smaller (by 22-27 mm, depending on gender) head-to-sternum horizontal distances, than passengers. Motorised belts significantly changed posture during initial braking, notably of the chest (which was shifted posteriorly by approximately 13 mm, depending on gender and role), while standard belts did not. Within a given belt type, occupants' change in posture was similar across gender and role during initial braking.},

The objective of this study was to develop an injury criterion for the mandible based on blunt impact while the jaw was restrained. Previous studies have attempted to characterize the injury risk of blunt impact to the mandible; however, due to the translation of the mandible during impact and a limited number of fractured specimens, previous studies were not able to produce an injury criterion. Blunt impact to a restrained mandible is relevant to a wide array of helmeted individuals, including the military population and sports that require helmets with chinstraps. Therefore, in this study, specimens were positioned with restrained jaws and impacted using a monorail drop tower with a gravity-driven cylindrical impactor. Nineteen of 22 specimens sustained at least one fracture during testing. Injury cases had an average impact energy of 15.0\,{$\pm$}\,5.7 J (11.1\,{$\pm$}\,4.2\,ft-lb) and a fracture force of 2684\,{$\pm$}\,726\,N (603\,{$\pm$}\,163\,lbf). Results were used to generate an impactor force based injury criterion through survival analysis. Risk of injury was modeled using a Weibull distribution and a 50\% risk of injury was found to occur at approximately 2834\,N (637\,lbf). The developed injury risk curve can be used to characterize injury to the restrained mandible for future testing and research studies, especially in the development of maxillofacial protective equipment.},

  abstract = {Objective: The significant computational resources required to execute detailed human body finite-element models has motivated the development of faster running, simplified models (e.g., GHBMC M50-OS). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability to modularly incorporate the validated GHBMC M50-O brain model into the simplified model (GHBMC M50-OS+B), which allows for localized analysis of the brain in a fraction of the computation time required for the detailed model. The objective of this study is to validate the head and neck kinematics of the GHBMC M50-O and M50-OS (detailed and simplified versions of the same model) against human volunteer test data in frontal and lateral loading. Furthermore, the effect of modular insertion of the detailed brain model into the M50-OS is quantified.Methods: Data from the Navy Biodynamics Laboratory (NBDL) human volunteer studies, including a 15g frontal, 8g frontal, and 7g lateral impact, were reconstructed and simulated using LS-DYNA. A five-point restraint system was used for all simulations, and initial positions of the models were matched with volunteer data using settling and positioning techniques. Both the frontal and lateral simulations were run with the M50-O, M50-OS, and M50-OS+B with active musculature for a total of nine runs.Results: Normalized run times for the various models used in this study were 8.4 min/ms for the M50-O, 0.26 min/ms for the M50-OS, and 0.97 min/ms for the M50-OS+B, a 32- and 9-fold reduction in run time, respectively. Corridors were reanalyzed for head and T1 kinematics from the NBDL studies. Qualitative evaluation of head rotational accelerations and linear resultant acceleration, as well as linear resultant T1 acceleration, showed reasonable results between all models and the experimental data. Objective evaluation of the results for head center of gravity (CG) accelerations was completed via ISO TS 18571, and indicated scores of 0.673 (M50-O), 0.638 (M50-OS), and 0.656 (M50-OS+B) for the 15g frontal impact. Scores at lower g levels yielded similar results, 0.667 (M50-O), 0.675 (M50-OS), and 0.710 (M50-OS+B) for the 8g frontal impact. The 7g lateral simulations also compared fairly with an average ISO score of 0.565 for the M50-O, 0.634 for the M50-OS, and 0.606 for the M50-OS+B. The three HBMs experienced similar head and neck motion in the frontal simulations, but the M50-O predicted significantly greater head rotation in the lateral simulation.Conclusion: The greatest departure from the detailed occupant models were noted in lateral flexion, potentially indicating the need for further study. Precise modeling of the belt system however was limited by available data. A sensitivity study of these parameters in the frontal condition showed that belt slack and muscle activation have a modest effect on the ISO score. The reduction in computation time of the M50-OS+B reduces the burden of high computational requirements when handling detailed HBMs. Future work will focus on harmonizing the lateral head response of the models and studying localized injury criteria within the brain from the M50-O and M50-OS+B.},

  abstract = {Reliable computer models are needed for a better understanding of the physical mechanisms of skull fracture in accidental hits, falls, bicycle - motor vehicle \& car accidents and assaults. The performance and biofidelity of these models depend on the correct anatomical representation and material description of these structures. In literature, a strain energy criterion has been proposed to predict skull fractures. However, a broad range of values for this criterion has been reported. This study investigates if the impactor orientation, scalp thickness and material model of the skull could provide us with insight in the influencing factors of this criterion. 18 skull fracture experiments previously performed in our research group were reproduced in finite element simulations. Subject-specific skull geometries were derived from medical images and used to create high-quality finite element meshes. Based on local Hounsfield units, a subject-specific isotropic material model was assigned. The subject-specific models were able to predict fractures who matched visually with the corresponding experimental fracture patterns and provided detailed fracture patterns. The sensitivity study showed that small variations in impactor positioning as well as variations of the local geometry (frontal-temporal-occipital) strongly influenced the skull strain energy. Subject-specific modelling leads to a more accurate prediction of the force-displacement curve. The average error of the peak fracture force for all the 18 cases is 0.4190 for the subject-specific and 0.4538 for the homogeneous material model, for the displacement; 0.3368 versus 0.3844. But it should be carefully interpreted as small variations in the computational model significantly influence the outcome.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether an energy failure level applies to the skull fracture mechanics in unembalmed post-mortem human heads under dynamic frontal loading conditions. A double-pendulum model was used to conduct frontal impact tests on specimens from 18 unembalmed post-mortem human subjects. The specimens were isolated at the occipital condyle level, and pre-test computed tomography images were obtained. The specimens were rigidly attached to an aluminum pendulum in an upside down position and obtained a single degree of freedom, allowing motion in the plane of impact. A steel pendulum delivered the impact and was fitted with a flat-surfaced, cylindrical aluminum impactor, which distributed the load to a force sensor. The relative displacement between the two pendulums was used as a measure for the deformation of the specimen in the plane of impact. Three impact velocity conditions were created: low (3.60 {$\pm$} 0.23 m/sec), intermediate (5.21 {$\pm$} 0.04 m/sec), and high (6.95 {$\pm$} 0.04 m/sec) velocity. Computed to-mography and dissection techniques were used to detect pathology. If no fracture was detected, repeated tests on the same specimen were performed with higher impact energy until fracture occurred. Peak force, displacement and energy variables were used to describe the biomechanics. Our data suggests the existence of an energy failure level in the range of 22\textendash 24 J for dynamic frontal loading of an intact unembalmed head, allowed to move with one degree of freedom. Further experiments, however, are necessary to confirm that this is a definitive energy criterion for skull fracture following impact.},

  abstract = {The purposes of this study were to measure the relative linear and angular displacements of each pair of adjacent cervical vertebrae and to compute changes in distance between two adjacent facet joint landmarks during low posterior-anterior (+Gx) acceleration without significant hyperextension of the head. A total of twentysix low speed rear-end impacts were conducted using six postmortem human specimens. Each cadaver was instrumented with two to three neck targets embedded in each cervical vertebra and nine accelerometers on the head. Sequential x-ray images were collected and analyzed. Two seatback orientations were studied. In the global coordinate system, the head, the cervical vertebrae, and the first or second thoracic vertebra (T1 or T2) were in extension during rear-end impacts. The head showed less extension in comparison with the cervical spine. Relative motion for each cervical motion segment went from flexion at the upper cervical levels to extension at the lower cervical levels, with a transition region at the mid-cervical levels. This rotational pattern formed an "S" shape in the cervical spine during the initial phase of low-speed rear impacts. A pair of facet joint landmarks on each cervical motion segment was used to measure the distance across the joint space. Uni-axial facet capsular strains were calculated by dividing changes in this distance over the original distance in seven tests using three specimens. In 20-degree seatback tests, the average strain was 32+/-11\% for the C2/C3 facet joint (17\%-43\% range), and 59+/-26\% for the C3/C4 facet joint (41\%-97\% range). The C4/C5 and C5/C6 facet joints exhibited peak tensile or compressive strains in different specimens. In 0-degree seatback tests, the average strain was 28+/-11\% for the C2/C3 facet joint (21\%-41\% range), 30+/-9\% for the C3/C4 facet joint (21\%-39\% range), 22+/-4\% for the C4/C5 facet joint (19\%-25\% range), and 60+/-13\% for the C5/C6 facet joint (51\%-69\% range). In 20-degree seatback tests, there was less initial cervical lordosis, more upward ramping of the thoracic spine, and more relative rotation of each cervical motion segment in comparison with the 0-degree seatback tests. Relative to T1, the head went from flexion to extension for 20-degree seatback tests while stayed in extension for 0-degree seatback tests.},

  abstract = {Spine-related diseases have high morbidity and cause a huge burden of social cost. Spine imaging is an essential tool for noninvasively visualizing and assessing spinal pathology. Segmenting vertebrae in computed tomography (CT) images is the basis of quantitative medical image analysis for clinical diagnosis and surgery planning of spine diseases. Current publicly available annotated datasets on spinal vertebrae are small in size. Due to the lack of a large-scale annotated spine image dataset, the mainstream deep learning-based segmentation methods, which are data-driven, are heavily restricted. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale spine CT dataset, called CTSpine1K, curated from multiple sources for vertebra segmentation, which contains 1,005 CT volumes with over 11,100 labeled vertebrae belonging to different spinal conditions. Based on this dataset, we conduct several spinal vertebrae segmentation experiments to set the first benchmark. We believe that this large-scale dataset will facilitate further research in many spine-related image analysis tasks, including but not limited to vertebrae segmentation, labeling, 3D spine reconstruction from biplanar radiographs, image super-resolution, and enhancement.},

  abstract = {Modeling the mechanical response of the brain has become increasingly important over the past decades. Although mechanical stimuli to the brain are small under physiological conditions, mechanics plays a significant role under pathological conditions including brain development, brain injury, and brain surgery. Well calibrated and validated constitutive models for brain tissue are essential to accurately simulate these phenomena. A variety of constitutive models have been proposed over the past three decades, but no general consensus on these models exists. Here, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of state-of-the-art modeling of the brain tissue. We categorize the different features of existing models into time-independent, time-dependent, and history-dependent contributions. To model the time-independent, elastic behavior of the brain tissue, most existing models adopt a hyperelastic approach. To model the time-dependent response, most models either use a convolution integral approach or a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. We evaluate existing constitutive models by their physical motivation and their practical relevance. Our comparison suggests that the classical Ogden model is a well-suited phenomenological model to characterize the time-independent behavior of the brain tissue. However, no consensus exists for mechanistic, physics-based models, neither for the time-independent nor for the time-dependent response. We anticipate that this review will provide useful guidelines for selecting the appropriate constitutive model for a specific application and for refining, calibrating, and validating future models that will help us to better understand the mechanical behavior of the human brain.},

  abstract = {Objective: The goal of this study was to implement active musculature into the Global Human Body Models Consortium (GHBMC) average male simplified occupant model (M50-OS v2) and validate its performance in low-speed frontal crash scenarios.Methods: Volunteer and postmortem human subjects (PMHS) data from low-speed frontal sled tests by Beeman et al., including 2.5 and 5.0 g acceleration pulses, were used to simulate events in LS-DYNA. All muscles were modeled as 1D beam elements and assigned a Hill-type muscle material. From the output of proportional\textendash integral\textendash derivative (PID) controllers, the activation level for each muscle was calculated using a sigmoid function, representing the firing rate of motor neurons. The PID controller attempts to preserve the initial posture of the model. Percentage muscle contribution for all skeletal muscles was precalculated using the M50-OS with active muscles (M50-OS + Active). The M50-OS + Active employs varying levels of neural delays to represent volunteer relaxed and braced conditions, taken from literature. Braced condition experiments were simulated using elevated joint angle set values for the PID controller. The M50-OS + Active model was used to simulate 2 muscle conditions (relaxed and braced) at 2 pulse severities (2.5 and 5.0 g). A control set of simulations was conducted to compare the effect of adding active muscle. Ten whole-body simulations were conducted.Results: The results from volunteer simulations showed a strong dependence of reaction loads and kinematics on muscle activation. Compared to baseline, M50-OS, at 5.0 g acceleration, 33.3\% and 7.6\% decreases were observed in the overall head kinematics of the M50-OS + Active for the braced and relaxed conditions, respectively. Regarding the anterior direction, similar reductions in overall kinematics were observed for both volunteer test conditions. In comparison to control simulations in which no active muscle was implemented, objective evaluation scores increased markedly at both speeds for the braced condition. Little to no gain was found in the relaxed condition.Conclusions: The results justify the need for use of an active human body model for predicting low-speed frontal kinematics, particularly in the braced condition. Head kinematics were reduced when using active modeling for all simulations (braced and relaxed).},

  abstract = {The foundation for computational multiscale modeling of biological materials is in the quantum mechanical realm. At this scale, fundamental physical equations can be used to describe molecular systems and ab initio calculations can, in principle, be performed at the size scale of the electron. In practice, a number of assumptions are used to make computations tractable, such as those employed by density functional theory (DFT), and these assumptions allow for accurate results for the behavior of organic systems at the next scale up of individual molecules. These calculations can serve as the basis, via length-scale bridging for further simplifications used to motivate classical force field atomic models that are useful for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on scales up to millions or even billions of atoms. This is in contrast to DFT, which is limited computationally to at most a few hundred atoms. In this chapter, we will briefly introduce the physics that governs molecular interactions at the smallest scale (electron) and the computational techniques used in solutions to these fundamental equations. We will then discuss the length-scale bridge between first principles (electron) calculation and classical force field models (atom). We will then review an existing formalism for modeling MD of biologically relevant molecules and demonstrate how it is informed by lower length-scale simulation. Finally, we will outline the process for developing new force fields using simple hydrocarbons as a model system.},

  abstract = {Despite numerous research efforts, the precise mechanisms of concussion have yet to be fully uncovered. Clinical studies on high-risk populations, such as contact sports athletes, have become more common and give insight on the link between impact severity and brain injury risk through the use of wearable sensors and neurological testing. However, as the number of institutions operating these studies grows, there is a growing need for a platform to share these data to facilitate our understanding of concussion mechanisms and aid in the development of suitable diagnostic tools. To that end, this paper puts forth two contributions: 1) a centralized, open-source platform for storing and sharing head impact data, in collaboration with the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research informatics system (FITBIR), and 2) a deep learning impact detection algorithm (MiGNet) to differentiate between true head impacts and false positives for the previously biomechanically validated instrumented mouthguard sensor (MiG2.0), all of which easily interfaces with FITBIR. We report 96\% accuracy using MiGNet, based on a neural network model, improving on previous work based on Support Vector Machines achieving 91\% accuracy, on an out of sample dataset of high school and collegiate football head impacts. The integrated MiG2.0 and FITBIR system serve as a collaborative research tool to be disseminated across multiple institutions towards creating a standardized dataset for furthering the knowledge of concussion biomechanics.},

As these structures are over-stretched, become weak, and exhibit laxity, pelvic floor disorders such as pelvic organ prolapse occur. Although several surgical procedures to treat pelvic floor disorders are directed toward the USLs, there is still a lot that is unknown about their function. This manuscript presents a review of the current knowledge on the mechanical properties of the USLs. The anatomy, microstructure, and clinical significance of the USLs are first reviewed. Then, the results of published experimental studies on the in vivo and ex vivo, uniaxial and biaxial tensile tests are compiled. Based on the existing findings, research gaps are identified and future research directions are discussed. The purpose of this exhaustive review is to help new researchers navigate scientific literature on the mechanical properties of the USLs. The use of these structures remains very popular in reconstructive surgeries that restore and augment the support of pelvic organs, especially as synthetic surgical mesh implants continue to be highly controversial.},

The second load case is a lumbar functional spine unit (FSU) loaded in compression using a drop tower setup, producing strain rates of up to 48/s. The IVD simulations were found to have a better agreement with the experiments than the FSU simulations, and the ranking of which HBMs matched best to the experiment differed by load case.

In order to generate non-censored rib fracture data, a total of 47 strain gages were placed throughout the thorax of two human cadavers (1 male, 1 female). In order to simulate thoracic loading from a severe car crash, a table-top belt loading device was developed that utilizes a servo-hydraulic test machine to apply a dynamic input. The belt load pulse was configured to result in 40\% chest compression through a 150 ms load and unload cycle. Potentiometers and accelerometers measured the chest compression and acceleration at three locations, load cells in line with the belt provided belt loads, and load cells on the posterior side of the thorax measured the reaction loads. The time histories of each strain gage were analyzed to determine the time of fracture which could then be compared directly to the reaction loads and chest displacements at that exact time, thereby creating a non-censored data set. In both cadavers, all fractures (20 for female and 12 for male) occurred within the first 35\% compression of the thorax. By utilizing this technique, the exact timing of an injury level can be characterized relative to the mechanical parameters.},

The force applied to and the displacement of the loading point on the rib were measured and used to determine the moment\textendash angle responses.

Significant inter-subject variability was observed for the cranial\textendash caudal flexion (p{$<$}0.05) while no intra-subject variability appeared.

  abstract = {Datasets obtained from cadaveric experimentation are broadly used in validating finite element models of head injury. Due to the complexity of such measurements in soft tissues, experimentalists have relied on tissue-embedded radiographic or sonomicrometry tracking markers to resolve tissue motion caused by impulsive loads. Dynamic coupling of markers with the surrounding tissue has been a previous concern, yet a thorough sensitivity investigation of marker influences on tissue deformation has not been broadly discussed. Technological improvements to measurement precision have bolstered confidence in acquired data; however, precision is often conflated with accuracy; the inclusion of markers in the tissue may alter its natural response, resulting in a loss of accuracy associated with an altered displacement field. To gain an understanding of how marker properties may influence the measured response to impact, we prepared a set of nine marker designs using a Taguchi L9 array to investigate marker design choice sensitivity. Each of these designs was cast into a block of tissue simulant and subjected to repeated drop tests. Vertical displacement was measured and compared to the response of the neat material, which contained massless tracking markers. Medium density and medium stiffness markers yielded the least deviation from the neat material response. The results provide some design guidelines indicating the importance of maintaining marker matrix density ratio below 1.75 and marker stiffness below 1.0\,MPa. These properties may minimize marker interference in tissue deformation. Overall, embedded marker properties must be considered when measuring the dynamic response of tissue.},

Objective~         This study provides anatomic data relevant to areas of screw placement into the occiput during occipitocervical fixation.         Summary of Background Data~         Few reports exist regarding the morphometrics of the occipital bone and intracranial structures relevant to occipitocervical fusion.         Method~         The thickness of the posterior inferior occipital bone was measured relative to a 10 \texttimes{} 5 cm grid. Sections were evaluated grossly and histologically. The projections of the posterior dural venous sinuses were determined by direct measurements.         Results~         The maximum thickness of the occipital bone, which ranged from 11.5 to 15.1 mm in males and from 9.7 to 12.0 mm in females, was at the level of the external occipital protuberance. The occipital bone was thicker than 8 mm in an area extending laterally from the external occipital protuberance for 23 mm and consisted of dense cortical bone with little or no diploic bone. The projection of most of the torcula on the external surface of the occipital bone was located superior to the center of the external occipital protuberance (mean, 12.6 mm superior and 4.7 mm inferior to external occipital protuberance), whereas that of the transverse sinus was distributed more evenly above and below the external occipital protuberance (mean, 7.3 mm superior and 6.5 mm inferior).         Conclusions~         Screws that are 8-mm long may be inserted in the region of the superior nuchal line (Level 0) extending 2 cm laterally from the center of the external occipital protuberance, 1 cm from the midline at a level 1 cm inferior to the external occipital protuberance (Level 1), and 0.5 cm from the midline at a level 2 cm inferior to the external occipital protuberance (Level 2). The major dural venous sinuses are situated immediately beneath the thickest regions of the occiput and are at risk of penetrative injury during screw placement.},

It also invites reflection to support the understanding and evolution of PBL and CDIO, and indicates specifically what the communities can learn from each other. It is noted that while the two approaches share many underlying values, they only partially overlap as strategies for educational reform. The conclusions are that practitioners have much to learn from each other's experiences through a dialogue between the communities, and that PBL and CDIO can play compatible and mutually reinforcing roles, and thus can be fruitfully combined to reform engineering education.},

  abstract = {The Crash Injury Research Engineering Network (CIREN) database contains detailed medical and crash information on a large number of severely injured occupants in motor vehicle crashes. CIREN's major limitation for stand-alone analyses to explore injury risk factors is that control subjects without a given injury type must have another severe injury to be included in the database. This leads to bias toward the null in the estimation of risk associations. One method to cope with this limitation is to obtain information about occupants without a given injury type from the National Automotive Sampling System's Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS), which is a probability sample of towaway crashes, containing similar crash information, but less medical detail. Combining CIREN and NASS-CDS in this manner takes advantage of the increased sample size when outcomes are available in both datasets; otherwise NASS-CDS can serve as a sample of controls to be combined with CIREN cases, possibly under a sensitivity analysis that includes and excludes NASS-CDS subjects whose status as a control is uncertain. Because CIREN is not a probability sample of crashes that meet its inclusion criteria, we develop a method to estimate the probability of selection for the CIREN cases using data from NASS-CDS. These estimated probabilities are then used to compute ``pseudo-weights'' for the CIREN cases. These pseudo-weights not only allow for reduced bias in the estimation of risk associations, they allow direct prevalence estimates to be made using medical outcome data available only in CIREN. We illustrate the use of these methods with both simulation studies and application to estimation of prevalence and predictors of AIS 3+ injury risk to head, thorax, and lower extremity regions, as well as prevalence and predictors of acetabular pelvic fractures. Results of these analyses demonstrate combining NASS and CIREN data can yield improvements in mean square error and nominal confidence interval coverage over analyses that use either the NASS-CDS or the CIREN sample alone.},

Legislation can be a very strong policy instrument to promote traffic safety. Examples are given of major changes in road user behaviour and accidents associated with the introduction of new legislation. These examples also show that the effects of new laws may erode over time. To sustain the effects of legislation in the long term, effective enforcement is needed. Factors that influence the effects of enforcement are discussed and accident modification functions associated with enforcement are presented. Challenges in maintaining a high level of enforcement in the long run are discussed. Finally, the possibilities of motivating road users to adopt safer behaviour by means of education are discussed. It is concluded that some educational measures may improve safety, but that not all educational measures are likely to do so. Characteristics of the more effective educational measures are discussed.},

Many of the models use strain as output but with different percentile values such as 100th, 95th, 90th, and 50th percentiles. Some use the element value, whereas other use the nodal average value for the element. Little is known how strain post-processing is affecting the injury predictions and evaluation of different prevention systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of strain output on injury prediction and ranking. Two models with different mesh densities were evaluated (KTH Royal Institute of Technology head model and the Total Human Models for Safety (THUMS)). Pulses from reconstructions of American football impacts with and without a diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury were applied to the models. The value for 100th, 99th, 95th, 90th, and 50th percentile for element and nodal averaged element strain was evaluated based on peak values, injury risk functions, injury predictability, correlation in ranking, and linear correlation. The injury risk functions were affected by the post-processing of the strain, especially the 100th percentile element value stood out. Meanwhile, the area under the curve (AUC) value was less affected, as well as the correlation in ranking (Kendall9s tau 0.71-1.00) and the linear correlation (Pearson9s r2 0.72-1.00). With the results presented in this study, it is important to stress that the same post-processed strain should be used for injury predictions as the one used to develop the risk function.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Since no experimental modal analysis can be conducted in vivo, we employ a quasi-static finite element (FE) method (Simulia/ABAQUS) using the Lanczos eigensolver. The human head (including the neck) mesh was created using Simpleware ScanIP software containing 1248,397 elements with the total volume being 4923.62 cm3 as the brain was 1189 cm3. The FE analysis revealed that the first fundamental frequency for the whole head and the confined brain in the head was 22.3 Hz and 13.9 Hz, respectively. The second resonant frequency for the whole head and brain were 23.8 Hz and 14.2 Hz, respectively. The third resonant frequencies for the whole head and brain were 24.0 Hz and 14.3 Hz, respectively. Finally, the first three fundamental modes were in torsion. The relevance of these mechanical resonant frequencies is that when one wants to design a helmet, they will need to stay away from these frequencies in their design. Furthermore, if a mechanical impact strikes at one of these frequencies, a more deleterious response can arise because of the larger displacements induced to the resonating brain.},

No studies have validated the accuracy of these models in predicting the structural mechanics of costal cartilage. Two heterogeneities \textendash{} the perichondrium and calcified regions \textendash{} may affect the behavior of costal cartilage in a manner not accounted for by current models. This study sought to investigate the predictive ability of subject-specific models of whole costal cartilage segments, with the calcified regions modeled distinctly and with the perichondrium removed (from the physical specimens as well as from the simulations). Finite element models were developed in the case of five cadaveric costal cartilage segments. The properties of the cartilage were derived from indentation testing of each specimen, where the characteristic average instantaneous elastic moduli ranged from 8.7 to 12.6MPa. Matched simulations and experiments were then performed, subjecting each specimen to cantilever-like loading with a dynamic posterior displacement of the sternal boundary (all other boundary degrees-of-freedom fixed). The models predicted the resulting peak anterior\textendash posterior forces generated on the costal boundary with a minimum error of 1\% and a maximum error of 36\%. These results provide support to the previous implicit assumption that insight can be gained into the structural behavior of costal cartilage by observing the local material properties (when calcified regions are included and the perichondrium is removed). Future work includes the addition of the perichondrium, so as to model the whole costal cartilage composite structure.},

  abstract = {This study sought to develop a strain-based probabilistic method to predict rib fracture risk with whole-body finite element (FE) models, and to describe a method to combine the results with collision exposure information to predict injury risk and potential intervention effectiveness in the field. An age-adjusted ultimate strain distribution was used to estimate local rib fracture probabilities within an FE model. These local probabilities were combined to predict injury risk and severity within the whole ribcage. The ultimate strain distribution was developed from a literature dataset of 133 tests. Frontal collision simulations were performed with the THUMS (Total HUman Model for Safety) model with four levels of delta-V and two restraints: a standard 3-point belt and a progressive 3.5\textendash 7 kN force-limited, pretensioned (FL+PT) belt. The results of three simulations (29 km/h standard, 48 km/h standard, and 48 km/h FL+PT) were compared to matched cadaver sled tests. The numbers of fractures predicted for the comparison cases were consistent with those observed experimentally. Combining these results with field exposure informantion ({$\Delta$}V, NASS-CDS 1992\textendash 2002) suggests a 8.9\% probability of incurring AIS3+ rib fractures for a 60 year-old restrained by a standard belt in a tow-away frontal collision with this restraint, vehicle, and occupant configuration, compared to 4.6\% for the FL+PT belt. This is the first study to describe a probabilistic framework to predict rib fracture risk based on strains observed in human-body FE models. Using this analytical framework, future efforts may incorporate additional subject or collision factors for multi-variable probabilistic injury prediction.},

  abstract = {The development of advanced injury prediction models requires biomechanical and injury tolerance information for all regions of the body. While numerous studies have investigated injury mechanics of the thorax under frontal impact, there remains a dearth of information on the injury mechanics of the torso under blunt impact to the back. A series of hub-impact tests were performed to the back surface of the mid-thorax of four mid-size male cadavers. Repeated tests were performed to characterize the biomechanical and injury response of the thorax under various impact speeds (1.5m/s, 3m/s and 5.5m/s). Deformation of the chest was recorded with a 59-gage chestband. Subject kinematics were also recorded with a high-speed optoelectronic 3D motion capture system. In the highest-severity tests, peak impact forces ranged from 6.9 to 10.5kN. The peak change in extension angle measured between the 1st thoracic vertebra and the lumbar spine ranged from 39 to 62\textdegree. The most commonly observed injuries were strains of the costovertebral/costotransverse joint complexes, rib fractures, and strains of the interspinous and supraspinous ligaments. The majority of the rib fractures occurred in the rib neck between the costovertebral and costotransverse joints. The prevalence of rib-neck fractures suggests a novel, indirect loading mechanism resulting from bending moments generated in the rib necks caused by motion of the spine. In addition to the injury information, the biomechanical responses quantified here will facilitate the future development and validation of human body models for predicting injury risk during impact to the back.},

  abstract = {Objective: As vehicle safety technologies and evaluation procedures advance, it is pertinent to periodically evaluate injury trends to identify continuing and emerging priorities for intervention. This study examined detailed injury distributions and injury risk trends in belted occupants in frontal automobile collisions (10 o'clock to 2 o'clock) using NASS-CDS (1998\textendash 2015).Methods: Injury distributions were examined by occupant age and vehicle model year (stratified at pre- and post-2009). Logistic regression models were developed to examine the effects of various factors on injury risk (by body region), controlling for delta-V, sex, age, height, body mass index (BMI), vehicle model year (again stratified at 2009).Results: Among other observations, these analyses indicate that newer model year vehicles (model year [MY] 2009 and later) carry less risk of Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 2+ and AIS 3+ injury compared to older model year vehicles, with odds ratios of 0.69 (AIS 2+) and 0.45 (AIS 3+). The largest reductions in risk between newer model year vehicles and older model year vehicles occur in the lower extremities and in the risk of skull fracture. There is no statistically significant change in risk of AIS 3+ rib fracture or sternum injury between model year categories. Females are at greater risk of AIS 2+ and AIS 3+ injury compared to males, with increased risk across most injury types.Conclusions: For belted occupants in frontal collisions, substantial reductions in injury risk have been realized in many body regions in recent years. Risk reduction in the thorax has lagged other body regions, resulting in increasing prevalence among skeletal injuries in newer model year vehicles (especially in the elderly). Injuries also remain common in the arm and hand/wrist for all age ranges studied. These results provide insight into where advances in the field have made gains in occupant protection and what injury types remain to be addressed.},

Improving the transparency and rigor of science is the responsibility of all who engage in it. Ongoing attempts to improve research credibility have, however, neglected an essential aspect of the academic cycle: the training of researchers and consumers of research. Principled teaching and mentoring involve imparting students with an understanding of research findings in light of epistemic uncertainty, and moreover, an appreciation of best practices in the production of knowledge. We introduce a Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT). Its main goal is to provide educators with a pathway towards the incremental adoption of principled teaching and mentoring practices, including open and reproducible research. FORRT will act as an initiative to support instructors, collating existing teaching pedagogies and materials to be reused and adapted for use within new and existing courses. Moreover, FORRT can be used as a tool to benchmark the current level of training students receive across six clusters of open and reproducible research practices: `reproducibility and replicability knowledge', `conceptual and statistical knowledge', `reproducible analyses', `preregistration', `open data and materials', and `replication research'. FORRT will strive to be an advocate for the establishment of principled teaching and mentorship as a fourth pillar of a true scientific utopia.[working document here: https://tinyurl.com/FORRTworkingDOC]}

  abstract = {Objective Crashworthiness assessments in the United States (U.S.) and the European Union (EU) include a large number of safety regulations and consumer testing programs. However, safety standards and testing procedures differ between the two regions. Not much research has been done in relation to this topic, because it has always been assumed that the accident environments in the U.S. and EU are not comparable. The objective of this study is to compare how vehicle occupants are severely injured in motor vehicle collisions in the U.S. and the EU by applying unsupervised learning to accident data.Methods A new methodology to identify clusters of seriously injured occupants in NASS-CDS was proposed by the authors in previous research. The current study goes one step further and uses the clusters to compare the injury patterns at the Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (MAIS) 3+ level of passenger vehicle occupants in the U.S. and German accident environments. The clustering model developed with NASS-CDS data is applied in this study to German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) data. A machine learning algorithm automatically assigned each GIDAS case to its most similar NASS-CDS cluster controlling for nine different parameters. Those included the injury severity at the body region level, biomechanical characteristics of the occupants, and technical severity of the crash.Results Differences and analogies between GIDAS and NASS-CDS data within clusters of seriously injured occupants are highlighted. One of the clusters groups the collisions with the greatest mass incompatibility in NASS-CDS and GIDAS data. The injury patterns in the clusters that include elderly people match significantly between the U.S. and German data sets. The lack of younger population and elevated body mass index (BMI) values in the GIDAS sample make the injury patterns within these population groups less comparable than in the other clusters.Conclusions Remarkably similar injury patterns at the MAIS 3+ level have been found in U.S. and German accident data sets after controlling for nine different parameters. This research provides evidence to indicate that how belted vehicle occupants are severely injured in the U.S. and in the EU is not necessarily different.},

Twenty (20) volunteers that were representative of the general population were subjected to seven test scenarios: a soccer ball impact to the forehead, a self-imposed hand strike to the forehead, vigorous head shaking, plopping down in a chair, jumping off a step, a seated drop onto the buttocks, and a vertical drop while seated supine in a chair. Some scenarios involved prescribed and well-controlled stimuli, while others allowed the volunteers to perform common activities at a self-selected level of intensity. Head accelerations up to 31~g and 2888~rad/s2 and neck loads up to 268~N in posterior shear, 526~N in compression, and 36 Nm in extension were recorded. Most head and neck injury criteria predicted a low risk of injury in all activities. However, rotational head accelerations and Neck Injury Criterion (NIC) values were much higher than some proposed tolerance limits in a large number of tests, all of which were non-injurious. The data from this study help us to establish an envelope of head and neck loading that is commonly encountered and presents a minimal risk of injury.},

By recreating the motion of human heads observed in video using instrumented test dummies in a laboratory, physical reconstructions allow for in-depth study of real-world head impacts using well-established surrogates such as the Hybrid III crash test dummy. The purpose of this paper is to review all aspects of the physical reconstruction methodology and discuss the advantages and limitations associated with different choices in case selection, study design, test surrogate, test apparatus, text matrix, instrumentation, and data processing. Physical reconstructions require significant resources to perform and are therefore typically limited to small sample sizes and a case series or case\textendash control study design. Their accuracy may also be limited by a lack of dummy biofidelity. The accuracy, repeatability, and sensitivity of the reconstruction process can be characterized and improved by good laboratory practices and iterative testing. Because wearable sensors have their own limitations and are not available or practical for many sports, physical reconstructions will continue to provide a useful and complementary approach to measuring head acceleration in sport for the foreseeable future.},

Metrics that describe the severity of brain injury based on head motion often do not represent the governing physics of brain deformation, rendering them ineffective over a broad range of head impact conditions. This study develops a brain injury metric based on the response of a second-order mechanical system, and relates rotational head kinematics to strain-based brain injury metrics: maximum principal strain (MPS) and cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM). This new metric, universal brain injury criterion (UBrIC), is applicable over a broad range of kinematics encountered in automotive crash and sports. Efficacy of UBrIC was demonstrated by comparing it to MPS and CSDM predicted in 1600 head impacts using two different finite element (FE) brain models. Relative to existing metrics, UBrIC had the highest correlation with the FE models, and performed better in most impact conditions. While UBrIC provides a reliable measurement for brain injury assessment in a broad range of head impact conditions, and can inform helmet and countermeasure design, an injury risk function was not incorporated into its current formulation until validated strain-based risk functions can be developed and verified against human injury data.},

Although numerous metrics have been proposed, many are based on empirically-derived models that use peak kinematics, which often limit their applicability to a narrow range of head impact conditions. However, over a broad range of impact conditions, brain deformation response to rotational head motion behaves similarly to a second-order mechanical system, which utilizes the full kinematic time history of a head impact. This study describes a new brain injury metric called Diffuse Axonal Multi-Axis General Evaluation (DAMAGE). DAMAGE is based on the equations of motion of a three-degree-of-freedom, coupled 2nd-order system, and predicts maximum brain strain using the directionally dependent angular acceleration time-histories from a head impact. Parameters for the effective mass, stiffness, and damping were determined using simplified rotational pulses which were applied multiaxially to a 50th percentile adult human male finite element model. DAMAGE was then validated with a separate database of 1747 head impacts including helmet, crash, and sled tests and human volunteer responses. Relative to existing rotational brain injury metrics that were evaluated in this study, DAMAGE was found to be the best predictor of maximum brain strain.},

Each healthy excised cadaveric FCL sample was tested in four conditions depending on primary collagen fiber alignment and regional loading.

Landmarks (n=106) selected from anonymized computed tomography (CT) scans of 63 adult males free of skeletal pathology were used to describe the form of the rib cage. Multivariate linear regression was used to determine a relationship between landmark location and age. Linear and quadratic models were also investigated. A permutation test employing 1\texttimes 105 random trials was used to assess the model significance for both model formulations. Linear relationships between the centroid size (CS) of a landmark set and the corresponding individual's height, weight, and BMI were conducted to enable scaling of the dimensionless results from the Procrustes analysis. A significance level of {$\alpha$}=0.05 was used for all tests. The average age of the study subjects was 57.0{$\pm$}17.3 years. Complete landmark sets were obtained from most of the scans (44 of 63). The quadratic relationship between the age and landmark location was found to be significant (p=0.037), thereby establishing a relationship between the age and thoracic shape change. The linear relationship was mildly significant as well (p=0.073). Significant relationships between the centroid size of the dataset and subject weight, height and BMI were determined, with the best-correlated value being weight (p=0.002, R2=0.22). Landmark datasets calculated using the quadratic model exhibited shape change consistent with the clinical observations (increasing kyphosis and rounding of the thoracic cage). Procrustes superimposition represents a potential improvement in the approach used to generate computational models for injury biomechanics studies. The coefficients from the quadratic model are provided and can be used to generate the complete set of model landmark data points at a given age.},

  abstract = {Objective: Computational human body models (HBMs) are nominally omnidirectional surrogates given their structural basis in human anatomy. As a result, such models are well suited for studies related to occupant safety in anticipated highly automated vehicles (HAVs). We utilize a well-validated HBM to study the head and neck kinematics in simulations of nontraditional occupant seating configurations.Methods: The GHBMC M50-O v. 4.4 HBM was gravity settled into a generic seat buck and situated in a seated posture. The model was simulated in angular increments of 15 degrees clockwise from forward facing to rear facing. A pulse of 17.0 kph (NASS median) was used in each to simulate a frontal impact for each of the 13 seating configurations. Belt anchor points were rotated with the seat; the airbag was appropriately powered based on delta-V, and was not used in rear-facing orientations. Neck forces and moments were calculated.Results: The 30-degree oblique case was found to result in the maximum neck load and sagittal moment, and thus Neck Injury Criteria (NIJ). Neck loads were minimized in the rear facing condition. The moments and loads, however, were greatest in the lateral seating configuration for these frontal crash simulations.Conclusions: In a recent policy statement on HAVs, the NHTSA indicated that vehicle manufacturers will be expected to provide countermeasures that will fully protect occupants given any planned seating or interior configurations. Furthermore, the agency indicated that virtual tests using human models could be used to demonstrate such efficacy. While the results presented are only appropriate for comparison within this study, they do indicate that human models provide reasonable biomechanical data for nontraditional occupant seating arrangements.},

Thus accurate representation of these passive tissues is critical for the assessment of kinematic response and the potential for crash induced injuries. Contemporary Human Body Models (HBMs) often incorporate overly stiff mechanical properties of passive tissues for numerical stability, which can affect the predicted kinematic response of the head and neck.Methods Soft tissue material properties including non-linearity, compression-tension asymmetry, and viscoelasticity were implemented in constitutive models for the skin, adipose, and passive muscle tissues, based on experimental data in the literature. A quasi-linear viscoelastic formulation was proposed for the skin, while a phenomenological hyper-viscoelastic model was used for the passive muscle and adipose tissues. A head-neck model extracted from a contemporary FE HBM was updated to include the new tissue models and assessed using head rotation angle for rear impact scenarios (3 g, 7 g, and 10 g peak accelerations), and compared to postmortem human surrogate (PMHS) data for 7 g impacts.Results The head rotation angle increased with the new material models for all three rear impact cases: (3 g: +43\%, 7 g: +52\%, 10 g: +71\%), relative to the original model. The increase in head rotation was primarily attributed to the improved skin model, with the passive muscle being a secondary contributor to the increase in response. A 52\% increase in head rotation for the 7 g impact improved the model response with respect to PMHS data, placing it closer to the experimental average, compared to the original model.Conclusions The improved skin, adipose tissue, and passive muscle material model properties, based on published experimental data, increased the neck compliance in rear impact, with improved correspondence to published PMHS test data for medium severity impacts.

  abstract = {Dozens of finite element models of the human brain have been developed for providing insight into the mechanical response of the brain during impact. Many models used in traumatic brain injury research are based on different computational techniques and approaches. In this study, a comprehensive review of the numerical methods implemented in 16 brain models was performed. Differences in element type, mesh size, element formulation, hourglass control, and solver were found. A parametric study using the SIMon FE brain model was performed to quantify the sensitivity of model outputs to differences in numerical implementation. Model outputs investigated in this study included nodal displacement (commonly used for validation) and maximum principal strain (commonly used for injury assessment), and these results were demonstrated using the loading characteristics of a reconstructed football concussion event. Order-of-magnitude differences in brain response were found when only changing the characteristics of the numerical method. Mesh type and mesh size had the largest effect on model response. These differences have important implications on the interpretation of results among different models simulating the same impacts, and of the results between model and in vitro experiments. Additionally, future studies need to better report the numerical methods used in the models.},

Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques and brain biomechanics provide new and necessary experimental data that can improve the biofidelity of FE brain models. In this study, the CAB-20MSym template model was developed, calibrated, and extensively verified. To implement material heterogeneity, a magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) template image was leveraged to define the relative stiffness gradient of the brain model. A multi-stage inverse FE (iFE) approach was used to calibrate the material parameters that defined the underlying nonlinear deviatoric response by minimizing the error between model-predicted brain displacements and experimental displacement data. This process involved calibrating the infinitesimal shear modulus of the material using low-severity, low-deformation impact cases and the material nonlinearity using high-severity, high-deformation cases from a dataset of in-situ{$\lnot$} brain displacements obtained from cadaveric specimens. To minimize the geometric discrepancy between the FE models used in the iFE calibration and the cadaveric specimens from which the experimental data were obtained, subject-specific models of these cadaveric brain specimens were developed and used in the calibration process. Finally, the calibrated material parameters were extensively verified using independent brain displacement data from 33 rotational head impacts, spanning multiple loading directions (sagittal, coronal, axial), magnitudes (20 \textendash{} 40 rad/s), durations (30 \textendash{} 60 ms), and severity.

The multifidelity surrogate encodes connections between information sources as a directed acyclic graph, and is trained via gradient-based minimization of a nonlinear least squares objective. While the vast majority of state-of-the-art assumes hierarchical connections between information sources, our approach works with flexibly structured information sources that may not admit a strict hierarchy. The formulation has two advantages: (1) increased data efficiency due to parsimonious multifidelity networks that can be tailored to the application; and (2) no constraints on the training data\textemdash we can combine noisy, non-nested evaluations of the information sources. Numerical examples ranging from synthetic to physics-based computational mechanics simulations indicate the error in our approach can be orders-of-magnitude smaller, particularly in the low-data regime, than single-fidelity and hierarchical multifidelity approaches.},

  abstract = {Introduction               Musculoskeletal models are important tools for studying movement patterns, tissue loading, and neuromechanics. Personalising bone anatomy within models improves analysis accuracy. Few studies have focused on personalising foot bone anatomy, potentially incorrectly estimating the foot's contribution to locomotion. Statistical shape models have been created for a subset of foot-ankle bones, but have not been validated. This study aimed to develop and validate statistical shape models of the functional segments in the foot: first metatarsal, midfoot (second-to-fifth metatarsals, cuneiforms, cuboid, and navicular), calcaneus, and talus; then, to assess reconstruction accuracy of these shape models using sparse anatomical data.                                         Methods               Magnetic resonance images of 24 individuals feet (age = 28 {$\pm$} 6 years, 52\% female, height = 1.73 {$\pm$} 0.8 m, mass = 66.6 {$\pm$} 13.8 kg) were manually segmented to generate three-dimensional point clouds. Point clouds were registered and analysed using principal component analysis. For each bone segment, a statistical shape model and principal components were created, describing population shape variation. Statistical shape models were validated by assessing reconstruction accuracy in a leave-one-out cross validation. Statistical shape models were created by excluding a participant's bone segment and used to reconstruct that same excluded bone using full segmentations and sparse anatomical data (i.e. three discrete points on each segment), for all combinations in the dataset. Tali were not reconstructed using sparse anatomical data due to a lack of externally accessible landmarks. Reconstruction accuracy was assessed using Jaccard index, root mean square error (mm), and Hausdorff distance (mm).                                         Results                                Reconstructions generated using full segmentations had mean Jaccard indices between 0.77 {$\pm$} 0.04 and 0.89 {$\pm$} 0.02, mean root mean square errors between 0.88 {$\pm$} 0.19 and 1.17 {$\pm$} 0.18 mm, and mean Hausdorff distances between 2.99 {$\pm$} 0.98 mm and 6.63 {$\pm$} 3.68 mm. Reconstructions generated using sparse anatomical data had mean Jaccard indices between 0.67 {$\pm$} 0.06 and 0.83 {$\pm$} 0.05, mean root mean square error between 1.21 {$\pm$} 0.54 mm and 1.66 {$\pm$} 0.41 mm, and mean Hausdorff distances between 3.21 {$\pm$} 0.94 mm and 7.19 {$\pm$} 3.54 mm. Jaccard index was higher (                 P                 {$<$} 0.01) and root mean square error was lower (                 P                 {$<$} 0.01) in reconstructions from full segmentations compared to sparse anatomical data. Hausdorff distance was lower (                 P                 {$<$} 0.01) for midfoot and calcaneus reconstructions using full segmentations compared to sparse anatomical data.                                                        Conclusion               For the first time, statistical shape models of the primary functional segments of the foot were developed and validated. Foot segments can be reconstructed with minimal error using full segmentations and sparse anatomical landmarks. In future, larger training datasets could increase statistical shape model robustness, extending use to paediatric or pathological populations.},

To protect pedestrians during Car-to-Pedestrian Collisions (CPC), subsystem impact tests are used in regulations. These tests provide insight but cannot characterize the complex vehicle-pedestrian interaction. The main purpose of this study was to develop and validate a detailed pedestrian Finite Element (FE) model corresponding to a 50th percentile male to predict CPC induced injuries. The model geometry was reconstructed using a multi-modality protocol from medical images and exterior scan data corresponding to a mid-sized male volunteer. To investigate injury response, this model included internal organs, muscles and vessels. The lower extremity, shoulder and upper body of the model were validated against Post Mortem Human Surrogate (PMHS) test data in valgus bending, and lateral/anterior-lateral blunt impacts, respectively. The whole-body pedestrian model was validated in CPC simulations using a mid-sized sedan and simplified generic vehicles bucks and previously unpublished PMHS coronal knee angle data. In the component validations, the responses of the FE model were mostly within PMHS test corridors and in whole body validations the kinematic and injury responses predicted by the model showed similar trends to PMHS test data. Overall, the detailed model showed higher biofidelity, especially in the upper body regions, compared to a previously reported simplified pedestrian model, which recommends using it in future pedestrian automotive safety research.},

This knowledge, combined with previously known biochemical cues, has greatly advanced the field of biomaterial development, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. It is now established that approaches to engineer biological tissues must integrate and approximate the mechanics, both static and dynamic, of native tissues. Nevertheless, the literature on the mechanical properties of biological tissues differs greatly in methodology, and the available data are widely dispersed. This Review gathers together the most important data on the stiffness of living tissues and discusses the intricacies of tissue stiffness from a materials perspective, highlighting the main challenges associated with engineering lifelike tissues and proposing a unified view of this as yet unreported topic. Emerging advances that might pave the way for the next decade's take on bioengineered tissue stiffness are also presented, and differences and similarities between tissues in health and disease are discussed, along with various techniques for characterizing tissue stiffness at various dimensions from individual cells to organs.},

  abstract = {Background The epidemiological transition of non-communicable diseases replacing infectious diseases as the main contributors to disease burden has been well documented in global health literature. Less focus, however, has been given to the relationship between sociodemographic changes and injury. The aim of this study was to examine the association between disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from injury for 195 countries and territories at different levels along the development spectrum between 1990 and 2017 based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 estimates. Methods Injury mortality was estimated using the GBD mortality database, corrections for garbage coding and CODEm\textemdash the cause of death ensemble modelling tool. Morbidity estimation was based on surveys and inpatient and outpatient data sets for 30 cause-of-injury with 47 nature-of-injury categories each. The Socio-demographic Index (SDI) is a composite indicator that includes lagged income per capita, average educational attainment over age 15 years and total fertility rate. Results For many causes of injury, age-standardised DALY rates declined with increasing SDI, although road injury, interpersonal violence and self-harm did not follow this pattern. Particularly for self-harm opposing patterns were observed in regions with similar SDI levels. For road injuries, this effect was less pronounced. Conclusions The overall global pattern is that of declining injury burden with increasing SDI. However, not all injuries follow this pattern, which suggests multiple underlying mechanisms influencing injury DALYs. There is a need for a detailed understanding of these patterns to help to inform national and global efforts to address injury-related health outcomes across the development spectrum.},

  abstract = {This study was conducted to resolve discrepancies and fill in gaps in the biomechanical impact response of the human abdomen to frontal impact loading. Three types of abdominal loading were studied: rigid-bar impacts, seatbelt loading, and close-proximity (out-of-position) airbag deployments. Eleven rigid-bar free-back tests were performed into the mid and upper abdomens of unembalmed instrumented human cadavers using nominal impact speeds of 6 and 9 m/s. Seven fixed-back rigid-bar tests were also conducted at 3, 6, and 9 m/s using one cadaver to examine the effects of body mass, spinal flexion, and repeated testing. Load-penetration corridors were developed and compared to those previously established by other researchers. Six seatbelt tests were conducted using three cadavers and a peak-loading rate of 3 m/s. The seatbelt loading tests were designed to maximize belt/abdomen interaction and were not necessarily representative of real-world crashes. The results were compared to data previously obtained by other researchers using swine and were used to establish a new abdominal load-penetration corridor for belt loading. Passenger frontal airbags were deployed into the closely positioned abdomen of three unembalmed cadavers. The penetration-time histories were used to guide the development of a repeatable high-speed surrogate airbag-loading device that uses a low-mass cylinder to simulate the initial breakout phase of close-proximity passenger airbag loading of the abdomen. This device was used to conduct simulated out-of-position airbag tests into three cadaver abdomens. The abdomen response data from these standardized tests were used to develop a load-penetration corridor for abdomen response to out-of-position airbag deployments.},

Relative motion, maximum principal strain, maximum shear strain, and intracranial pressure were measured in thirty-five impacts using eight human cadaver head and neck specimens. The effect of a helmet was evaluated. During impact, local brain tissue tends to keep its position and shape with respect to the inertial frame, resulting in relative motion between the brain and skull and deformation of the brain. The local brain motions tend to follow looping patterns. Similar patterns are observed for impact in different planes, with some degree of posterior-anterior and right-left symmetry. Peak coup pressure and pressure rate increase with increasing linear acceleration, but coup pressure pulse duration decreases. Peak average maximum principal strain and maximum shear are on the order of 0.09 for CFC 60 Hz data for these tests. Peak average maximum principal strain and maximum shear increase with increasing linear acceleration, coup pressure, and coup pressure rate. Linear and angular acceleration of the head are reduced with use of a helmet, but strain increases. These results can be used for the validation of finite element models of the human head.},

Although many FE studies of the cervical spine have been published, they typically develop their models using commercial software, making the sharing of models between researchers difficult. They also often model only one part of the cervical spine. The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate three FE models of the adult cervical spine using open-source software and to freely provide these models to the scientific community. The models were created from computed tomography scans of 26-, 59-, and 64-year old female subjects. These models were evaluated against previously published experimental and FE data. Despite the fact that all three models were assigned identical material properties and boundary conditions, there was notable variation in their biomechanical behavior. It was therefore apparent that these differences were the result of morphological differences between the models.},

The model identified females and older occupants (segmented by age 55\textendash 74, and 75 and older) as having a significantly higher risk of severe injuries in a crash. Further, interactions of older females with other factors, such as occupant seat position, crash type, and environmental factors were also shown to significantly impact the relative risk of a severe injury. This study revealed that females 75 years and older had the lowest odds of injury among all female occupants studied (OR=1.16) while females between 55 and 74 years old have higher risk of severe injuries (OR=1.74). All older females (55 and older) were at greater risk for head-on, side-impact and rear-end collisions. Seatbelt use reduced severe injuries for females in this age group, but not to the same extent as the rest of the population studied. Additionally, crashes in severe weather, which were less likely to result in severe injuries for the general population, increased the risk of severe injuries to females that were 55 and older. Among occupants of light trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans, older females were less likely than others to be severely injured. In this case, older females appear better off in vehicles which are larger and protect better in severe crashes. This research demonstrates that circumstances surrounding a crash greatly impact the severity of injuries sustained by older female occupants.},

  abstract = {This study assesses the ability to measure local cortical bone thickness, and to obtain mechanically relevant properties of rib cross-sections from clinical-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans of human ribs. The study utilized thirty-four sections of ribs published by Perz et~al. (2015) in three modalities: standard clinical CT (clinCT), high-resolution clinical CT (HRclinCT), and microCT (\textmu CT). Clinical-resolution images were processed using a Cortical Bone Mapping (CBM) algorithm applied to cross-cortex signals resampled perpendicularly to an initial smooth periosteal border. Geometric constraints were applied to remove outlier signals from consideration, and final predicted periosteal and endosteal borders from HRclinCT and clinCT were developed. Target values for local cortical thickness and for overall cross-sectional area and inertial properties were obtained from segmentation of the periosteal and endosteal borders on each corresponding \textmu CT image. Errors in prediction (mean\,{$\pm$}\,SD) of local cortical bone thickness for HRclinCT and clinCT resolutions were -0.03{$\pm$}0.17~mm and -0.05{$\pm$}0.22~mm, respectively, with R2 coefficients of determination from linear regression of 0.82 and 0.71 (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001 for both). Predicted cortical shell measures derived from the periosteal and endosteal borders included total cross-sectional area (prediction errors of 6\,{$\pm$}\,3\% and -1{$\pm$}5\% respectively for HRclinCT and clinCT with R2 correlations of 0.99 and 0.96), cortical shell area (errors of -3{$\pm$}8\% and -8{$\pm$}11\% with R2 correlations of 0.91 and 0.87), and principal area moment of inertia (errors of 2\,{$\pm$}\,8\% and -3{$\pm$}11\% with R2 correlations of 0.98 and 0.95). Results here show substantial reductions in rib cross-sectional measurement error compared to past histogram-based thresholding methods and provide first validation of the CBM method when applied to rib bones. With the ubiquity of clinical CT scans covering the thorax and ribs, this study opens the door for individualized and population-wide quantification of rib structural properties and their corresponding effects on rib injury.},

  abstract = {Background The objective of this study was to compare cortical thickness of rib specimens scanned with clinical computed tomography (clinical-CT) at 0.5 and 1.0\,mm slice thickness versus micro-CT at 0.05\,mm slice thickness. Cortical thickness variation and accuracy was explored by anatomical region (anterior vs. lateral) and cross-sectional quadrants (superior, interior, inferior, and exterior). Methods A validated cortical thickness algorithm was applied to clinical-CT and micro-CT scans of 17 rib specimens from six male post mortem human subjects aged 42\textendash 81 years. Each rib specimen was segmented and the thickness measurements were partitioned into cross-sectional quadrants in the anterior and lateral regions of the rib. Within each rib quadrant, the following were calculated: average thickness\,{$\pm$}\,standard deviation, mean thickness difference between clinical-CT and micro-CT, and a thickness ratio between clinical-CT and micro-CT. Correlations from linear regression and paired-t tests were determined for paired clinical-CT and micro-CT results. Results On average, the 0.5\,mm clinical-CT underestimated the micro-CT thickness by 0.005\,mm, while the 1.0\,mm clinical-CT overestimated the micro-CT thickness by 0.149\,mm. Thickness derived from 0.5\,mm clinical-CT showed greater significant linear correlations (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) with micro-CT thickness compared to 1.0\,mm clinical-CT. Conclusions The small mean differences and thickness ratios near 1 show validation for the cortical thickness algorithm when applied to rib clinical-CT scans. Using clinical-CT scans as way to accurately measure rib cortical thickness offers a non-invasive way to analyze millions of CT scans collected each year from males and females of all ages.},

The existing literature did not provide guidance on deciding between parameters collected in an experiment that would be best to use for the development of human injury probability curves (HIPC). The objective of this study was to use the Brier Metric Score (BMS) to identify the most appropriate metric from an experiment that predicts injury outcomes. The Brier Metric Score assesses how well a metric predicts the outcome for a censored data point (a lower BMS is better). Survival analysis was then conducted with the selected metric and the best distribution was selected using Akaike information criterion (AIC). Confidence intervals (CIs) and the normalized confidence interval width (NCIS) were calculated for the injury probability curve. The testing and validation of the methods described were performed using biomechanics data in the open literature. The methods for the HIPC development procedure detailed herein have been rigorously tested and used in the generation of WIAMan HIPCs and Injury Assessment Reference Curves (IARCs) for the WIAMan ATD, but can also be used in other ATD or PMHS injury risk curve development.},

  abstract = {Objective The objective of this study was to develop injury risk curves as a function of change in vehicle velocity for occupants in far-side lateral motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) by AIS level, body region, and specific AIS codes that commonly occur in this crash mode.Methods The National Automotive Sampling System-Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS) years 2000\textendash 2015 database was queried, resulting in 4,495 non-weighted far-side crashes. For each case, occupant age, sex, and the following metadata were collected: vehicle model year, vehicle body type, lateral delta-v, normalized PDOF, multiple impacts, belt use, seat position, object contacted, striking vehicle body type, maximum crush extent and side airbag deployment. Multivariable logistic regression was used to develop risk curves for AIS 2+ through 5+ injuries, AIS 2+ injuries by body region (head, thorax, lower extremity), and for each of the 10 most frequent far-side AIS 2+ injuries. Significant covariates were determined by backwards elimination (p {$<$} 0.05). The full dataset and a subsampled dataset of only cases with side airbag deployment were used to develop risk curves.Results For AIS 2+ through 5+ injury, greater delta-V was associated with greater injury risk (OR's: 2.48\textendash 3.66 per 11.9 kph increase) and belt use was associated with lower risk (OR's: 0.04\textendash 0.36 compared to unbelted). Multiple impacts were significant predictors of increased AIS 3+, 4+ and 5+ injury risk (OR's: 2.56, 2.27 and 2.83 compared to single impact). For AIS 2+ body region injuries, lateral delta-V and maximum CDC extent were positively associated with increased head, thorax and lower extremity injury risk while belt use was associated with lower risk. Increased lateral delta-v, unbelted status, and greater maximum CDC extent frequently increased injury risk for the most common far-side injuries. Side airbag deployment was not a significant covariate for the injury risk models.Conclusions The resulting risk models expand upon previous literature gaps to provide a more comprehensive view of contributors to injury risk for occupants in far-side MVCs. This study yields risk curves based on the latest available NASS-CDS data.},

  abstract = {Objective: Analyses of crash data have shown that older, obese, and/or female occupants have a higher risk of injury in frontal crashes compared to the rest of the population. The objective of this study was to use parametric finite element (FE) human models to assess the increased injury risks and identify safety concerns for these vulnerable populations.Methods: We sampled 100 occupants based on age, sex, stature, and body mass index (BMI) to span a wide range of the U.S. adult population. The target anatomical geometry for each of the 100 models was predicted by the statistical geometry models for the rib cage, pelvis, femur, tibia, and external body surface developed previously. A regional landmark-based mesh morphing method was used to morph the Global Human Body Models Consortium (GHBMC) M50-OS model into the target geometries. The morphed human models were then positioned in a validated generic vehicle driver compartment model using a statistical driving posture model. Frontal crash simulations based on U.S. New Car Assessment Program (U.S. NCAP) were conducted. Body region injury risks were calculated based on the risk curves used in the US NCAP, except that scaling was used for the neck, chest, and knee\textendash thigh\textendash hip injury risk curves based on the sizes of the bony structures in the corresponding body regions. Age effects were also considered for predicting chest injury risk.Results: The simulations demonstrated that driver stature and body shape affect occupant interactions with the restraints and consequently affect occupant kinematics and injury risks in severe frontal crashes. U-shaped relations between occupant stature/weight and head injury risk were observed. Chest injury risk was strongly affected by age and sex, with older female occupants having the highest risk. A strong correlation was also observed between BMI and knee\textendash thigh\textendash hip injury risk, whereas none of the occupant parameters meaningfully affected neck injury risks.Conclusions: This study is the first to use a large set of diverse FE human models to investigate the combined effects of age, sex, stature, and BMI on injury risks in frontal crashes. The study demonstrated that parametric human models can effectively predict the injury trends for the population and may now be used to optimize restraint systems for people who are not similar in size and shape to the available anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs). New restraints that adapt to occupant age, sex, stature, and body shape may improve crash safety for all occupants.},

  abstract = {This study aimed at evaluating the ability of morphed finite element (FE) human body models (HBMs) to reproduce the impact responses of post-mortem human subjects (PMHS) with various stature and shape. Ten side impact tests previously performed using seven PMHS under 3\,m/s and 8\,m/s impact velocities were selected for model evaluation. With weight, stature, sex, and age of PMHS, seven FE HBMs were developed by morphing the midsize male THUMS model into the target geometries predicted by the statistical skeleton and external body shape models. The model-predicted force histories, accelerations along the spine, and deflections in the chest and abdomen were compared to the test data. For comparison, simulations in all testing conditions were also conducted with the original midsize male THUMS, and the results from the THUMS simulations were scaled to the weight and stature from each PMHS. The CORrelation and Analysis (CORA) was used to evaluate the model accuracy, with CORA scores close to one indicating excellent agreement. Ten simulations using the morphed models exhibited 0.80\,{$\pm$}\,0.01, 0.80\,{$\pm$}\,0.01, 0.78\,{$\pm$}\,0.02, and 0.78\,{$\pm$}\,0.02 CORA scores for the impact forces to the thorax, abdomen, iliac-wings, and greater-trochanter, respectively; the corresponding CORA scores with the original THUMS were markedly lower at 0.60\,{$\pm$}\,0.06, 0.69\,{$\pm$}\,0.05, 0.71\,{$\pm$}\,0.05, and 0.69\,{$\pm$}\,0.04; while those for the scaled THUMS were 0.65\,{$\pm$}\,0.05, 0.71\,{$\pm$}\,0.05, 0.73\,{$\pm$}\,0.05, and 0.72\,{$\pm$}\,0.02, also lower than the morphed models. Across all simulations, the morphed HBMs demonstrated significantly higher accuracy than the THUMS with or without scaling. These results suggested the necessity of accounting for size and shape effects on predicting human responses in side impacts.},

  abstract = {Traffic calming is about measures to reduce vehicle speeds to below 50 km/h in order to reduce injury accidents, pollution and to make areas more liveable for people. Reduction of speed below 50 km/h is the most central measure as it both reduces risks and makes streets less attractive to car drivers. Traffic calming focuses on vulnerable road users, primarily pedestrians. In this paper, I have scrutinised efforts ever since the nineteenth century to improve safety for pedestrians. My conclusion is that lots of efforts are made, however without actually solving the basic problem, namely to strike a balance between the interests of pedestrians and the interests of motorists. The solutions have a clear tendency to give high priority to motorised traffic without improving. The safety for pedestrians is an acceptable level. One of the best examples is to make crossings\textemdash primarily zebra crossings\textemdash safe. I present an example from Sweden showing that pedestrian risks were higher on zebra crossings than on locations where there were no facilities for pedestrians. After a change of the law in the beginning of 2000, giving priority to pedestrians over motorists at zebra crossings, there was an increase of risk. This is where traffic calming comes in. By introducing effective speed reduction at the crossing the risk went down to approx. half. Round-top humps are the most effective measures, and an example from Gothenburg in Sweden shows that this kind of hump can be introduced on a very large scale and actually reduce pedestrian (and bicycle) risk significantly. The problem is that these humps are not designed optimally, thereby producing annoyance without necessarily producing the best safety outcome. Another efficient traffic calming measure is small roundabouts which can reduce severe accidents with pedestrians very significantly (up to 80\% reduction) and still offers quite good mobility for all road users. Finally, a study of traffic calming in India is presented. Comparisons of the speed reduction produced with the help of humps in the city of Lund, Sweden and similar ones in the city of Jaipur, India, showed that the speed calming effect was very similar in Lund and Jaipur. This result was very encouraging in the sense that based on this it was hypothesised that traffic calming should work in a fairly similar way in India as in many countries in (primarily) Europe. Large-scale trials in India would be extremely helpful in learning more about traffic calming which could assist low- and middle-income countries in forming new strategies making life for pedestrians both safer and more liveable.},

The generic ribs representing an average sized male, were created based on data from several sources and publications. The generic ribs were validated for stiffness and strain predictions in anterior-posterior bending. Essentially, both predicted rib stiffness and rib strain, measured at six locations, were within one standard deviation of the average result in the physical tests. These generic finite elements ribs are suitable for strain-based rib fracture risk predictions, when loaded in anterior-posterior bending. To ensure that human variability is accounted for in future studies, a rib parametric study was conducted. This study shows that the rib cross-sectional height, i.e., the smallest of the cross-sectional dimensions, accounted for most of the strain variance during anterior-posterior loading of the ribs. Therefore, for future rib fracture risk predictions with morphed models of the human thorax, it is important to accurately address rib cross-sectional height.},

Basic Procedures Fatalities were selected from 155~584 drivers included in the 2000-2005 Fatality Analysis Reporting System. Drivers were stratified by body mass index, confounders were adjusted for, and multiple logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratio (OR) of death in each body mass index class compared with normal weight. Main Findings The adjusted risk of death from lowest to highest, reported as the OR of death compared with normal weight with 95\% confidence intervals, was as follows: (1) overweight (OR, 0.952; 0.911-0.995; P = .0293), (2) slightly obese (OR, 0.996; 0.966-1.026; P = .7758), (3) normal weight, (4) underweight (OR, 1.115; 1.035-1.201; P = .0043), (5) moderately obese (OR, 1.212; 1.128-1.302; P {$<$} .0001), and (6) morbidly obese (OR, 1.559; 1.402-1.734; P {$<$} .0001).

  abstract = {Objectives: Earlier research has shown that the rear row is safer for occupants in crashes than the front row, but there is evidence that improvements in front seat occupant protection in more recent vehicle model years have reduced the safety advantage of the rear seat versus the front seat. The study objective was to identify factors that contribute to serious and fatal injuries in belted rear seat occupants in frontal crashes in newer model year vehicles.Methods: A case series review of belted rear seat occupants who were seriously injured or killed in frontal crashes was conducted. Occupants in frontal crashes were eligible for inclusion if they were 6 years old or older and belted in the rear of a 2000 or newer model year passenger vehicle within 10 model years of the crash year. Crashes were identified using the 2004\textendash 2015 National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS) and included all eligible occupants with at least one Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 3 or greater injury. Using these same inclusion criteria but split into younger (6 to 12 years) and older (55+ years) cohorts, fatal crashes were identified in the 2014\textendash 2015 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and then local police jurisdictions were contacted for complete crash records.Results: Detailed case series review was completed for 117 rear seat occupants: 36 with Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (MAIS) 3+ injuries in NASS-CDS and 81 fatalities identified in FARS. More than half of the injured and killed rear occupants were more severely injured than front seat occupants in the same crash. Serious chest injury, primarily caused by seat belt loading, was present in 22 of the injured occupants and 17 of the 37 fatalities with documented injuries. Nine injured occupants and 18 fatalities sustained serious head injury, primarily from contact with the vehicle interior or severe intrusion. For fatal cases, 12 crashes were considered unsurvivable due to a complete loss of occupant space. For cases considered survivable, intrusion was not a large contributor to fatality.Discussion: Rear seat occupants sustained serious and fatal injuries due to belt loading in crashes in which front seat occupants survived, suggesting a discrepancy in restraint performance between the front and rear rows. Restraint strategies that reduce loading to the chest should be considered, but there may be potential tradeoffs with increased head excursion, particularly in the absence of rear seat airbags. Any new restraint designs should consider the unique needs of the rear seat environment.},

  abstract = {Head acceleration measurement sensors are now widely deployed in the field to monitor head kinematic exposure in contact sports. The wealth of impact kinematics data provides valuable, yet challenging, opportunities to study the biomechanical basis of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and subconcussive kinematic exposure. Head impact kinematics are translated into brain mechanical responses through physics-based computational simulations using validated brain models to study the mechanisms of injury. First, this article reviews representative legacy and contemporary brain biomechanical models primarily used for blunt impact simulation. Then, it summarizes perspectives regarding the development and validation of these models, and discusses how simulation results can be interpreted to facilitate injury risk assessment and head acceleration exposure monitoring in the context of contact sports. Recommendations and consensus statements are presented on the use of validated brain models in conjunction with kinematic sensor data to understand the biomechanics of mTBI and subconcussion. Mainly, there is general consensus that validated brain models have strong potential to improve injury prediction and interpretation of subconcussive kinematic exposure over global head kinematics alone. Nevertheless, a major roadblock to this capability is the lack of sufficient data encompassing different sports, sex, age and other factors. The authors recommend further integration of sensor data and simulations with modern data science techniques to generate large datasets of exposures and predicted brain responses along with associated clinical findings. These efforts are anticipated to help better understand the biomechanical basis of mTBI and improve the effectiveness in monitoring kinematic exposure in contact sports for risk and injury mitigation purposes.},

  abstract = {Finite element Human Body Models are increasingly becoming vital tools for injury assessment and are expected to play an important role in virtual vehicle safety testing. With the aim of realizing models to study sex-differences seen in the injury- and fatality-risks from epidemiology, we developed models that represent an average female and an average male. The models were developed with an objective to allow tissue-based skeletal injury assessment, and thus non-skeletal organs and joints were defined with simplified characterizations to enhance computational efficiency and robustness. The model lineup comprises female and male representations of (seated) vehicle occupants and (standing) vulnerable road users, enabling the safety assessment of broader segments of the road user population. In addition, a new workflow utilized in the model development is presented. In this workflow, one model (the seated female) served as the base model while all the other models were generated as closely-linked derivative models, differing only in terms of node coordinates and mass distribution. This approach opens new possibilities to develop and maintain further models as part of the model lineup, representing different types of road users to reflect the ongoing transitions in mobility patterns (like bicyclists and e-scooter users). In this paper, we evaluate the kinetic and kinematic responses of the occupant and standing models to blunt impacts, mainly on the torso, in different directions (front, lateral, and back). The front and lateral impacts to the thorax showed responses comparable to the experiments, while the back impact varied with the location of impact (T1 and T8). Abdomen bar impact showed a stiffer load-deflection response at higher intrusions beyond 40~mm, because of simplified representation of internal organs. The lateral shoulder impact responses were also slightly stiffer, presumably from the simplified shoulder joint definition. This paper is the first in a series describing the development and validation of the new Human Body Model lineup, VIVA+. With the inclusion of an average-sized female model as a standard model in the lineup, we seek to foster an equitable injury evaluation in future virtual safety assessments.},

The present study was undertaken to evaluate differences in calculated Nij for the Global Human Body Model Consortium's detailed and simplified average 50th percentile male models. The simplified model is a computationally light version of the more detailed model and therefore it is of interest to achieve similar Nij values between the two models. These models were compared in 15 match paired conditions of rigid head impact and a mixture of 7 full body rigid hub and sled pulses, for 44 total simulations. Collectively, Nij values of the simplified model were found to exhibit a second-degree polynomial fit, allowing for a conversion to the prediction of the detailed model. Correlates were also derived for impact and inertial loading cases individually, for which the latter may be the subject of future work. The differences in Nij may be attributed to a variety of modeling approach differences related to neck muscles (attachment location and morphometric implementation), localization of head mass within the M50-OS, head geometry, and intervertebral joint space properties. With a primary focus on configurations in the anterior-posterior direction, there is a potential limitation in extensibility to lateral loading cases. In response to the relatively low Nij values exhibited, future work should evaluate the appropriateness of the established critical intercepts of Nij for computational human body models.},

  abstract = {Objective Approximately 40\% of the U.S. adult population are obese. An issue associated with this trend is proper seat belt fit for obese occupants. This study extends previous research, in which few individuals with high BMI ({$>$} 40 kg/m2) were included, by examining the relationship between participant and belt factors on belt fit for drivers with Class I-III obesity.Methods Posture and belt fit of 52 men and women with BMI from 31 to 59 kg/m2 (median 38 kg/m2) were measured in a laboratory vehicle mockup. Five seat belt configurations were achieved by manipulating the belt anchorage locations. Body and belt landmark locations were recorded using a three-dimensional coordinate measuring machine.Results Higher BMI was associated with a lap belt position further forward and higher relative to the pelvis. On average, the lap belt was positioned an additional 32 mm forward and 13 mm above the ASIS with each increasing level of obesity classification. Sex had a small effect after accounting for BMI and stature. The mean fore-aft location of the lap belt was 24 mm more forward for men vs. women and 12 mm higher for women vs. men at the same stature and BMI. On average, women used 50 mm more belt webbing in the lap and 92 mm more in the shoulder vs. men.Conclusions The results suggest that increasing levels of obesity class effectively introduces slack in the seat belt system by routing the belt further away from the skeleton. Because the belt is designed to engage the pelvis during a frontal crash, belt placements that are higher and further forward may increase injury risk by allowing excursions or submarining. Unique to this cohort, sex had an important effect on belt fit measures after taking into account stature and BMI. The participant and belt factors considered explained only about 40\% of the variance in belt fit. The remaining variance may be due to preference or exogenous body shape effects. Further research is needed to assess methods for enhanced seat belt fit for people with obesity, including addressing sex differences in belt routing.},

  abstract = {Establishing whether an infant's traumatic head injury results from an accidental or nonaccidental, abusive cause is a fundamental question in forensic investigations. Often practitioners are provided with either ``no explanation'' of the cause of the presenting injuries or only a brief description of a causal event, and therefore, struggle to establish a sufficiently detailed understanding of a cause-and-effect relationship with which to make a differential diagnosis. The head may be injured by many different mechanisms. Therefore, developing a necessary knowledge of the cause from practical experience and epidemiology alone is a significant challenge since there are very many biomechanical variables that require consideration. Experimentation with living infants is impossible, and infant cadaver availability is limited and problematic, and hence, modeling is an obvious path. Presented is the development of a coupled physical\textendash computational modeling methodology for the investigation of infant head injury. A physical surrogate infant head was created from high-resolution computer tomography scans with tissue material properties closely matched to tissue response data. An infant skull was 3D-printed from co-polymer materials and the brain, represented as a lumped mass, comprised of an injected gelatin/water mix. Experimental head impact responses were validated against Postmortem human surrogate (PMHS) head impact acceleration data. High speed digital image correlation optically measured linear and angular velocities and accelerations, strains, and strain rates. The ``global approximation,'' derived from the PMHS head impact acceleration data, was challenged by comparing regional and local acceleration data. The validated physical infant head surrogate, producing ``real world'' global, regional, and localized impact response data, was used to inform a computational finite element-head copy of the physical head model that was validated against the PMHS and physical model global impact response data. Experimental impact simulations were performed to investigate regional and localized injury vulnerability. Different regions of the head produced accelerations significantly greater than those calculated using the currently available method of measuring the ``global'' physical whole head response. The majority of material strain was produced within the relatively elastic suture and fontanelle regions rather than the skull bones. A subsequent parametric analysis was conducted to provide a correlation between fall height and areas of the maximum stress response. The coupled methodology shows significant potential for the study of infant head injury and is anticipated to be a motivating tool for the improvement of head injury understanding across a range of potentially injurious head loading scenarios. The methodology has proven a significant new step in characterizing and understanding infant head injury mechanics.},

The main injured part is the lower cervical spine and the transition to the thoracic vertebral column. Thoracic injuries (mainly rib fractures) are specific for the restraint system used. The 3-point-standard belt cause high local chest compression from the concentrated loading of the shoulder belt, sternum and rib fractures along the belt are the results. By using air bag restraints the chest compression is uniform due to the distributed loading of the air bag; this load distribution is injury preventive. An acceleration at the 1st thoracic vertebra in x-direction of 35 g produced, with a 50\% probability, a thoracic injury severity of AIS{$\geq$}3.During a 90\textdegree{} car to car or sled test with rigid or padded wall lateral collision with an impact speed of 24 to 60 km/h the cervical spine of the near side occupant is loaded indirectly, hereby the torso is impacted directly through the intruding side structures of the car. The injury mechanics of the cervical spine injuries is shearing and lateral flexion; mainly the cervical spine is injured. The direct impact of the intruding car side structures causes rib fractures at the impacted torso side as well as abdominal injuries. The number of rib fractures is age dependent, however not the abdominal injuries. The torso injury severity is defined mainly by the number of the rib fractures, contusions and lacerations of the lung are rare. A 50\% likelihood of a thoracic injury of AIS{$\geq$}4 for the investigated collective is associated with age = 38 years TTI = 155 acceleration at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra, y-direction = 90g VC at the level of the 4th rib = 0.83 m/s},

A mini-sled was designed to dynamically test a post mortem human subject head-neck complex. A six axis load cell was attached at the T3 level of the spine to measure the reaction loads at the upper thoracic spine for the frontal, oblique and side impacts, while T1 was attached to the load cell for the twist test. The post mortem human subject head, C3, and C5 were instrumented using accelerometers and angular rate sensors to capture head and cervical kinematics. Five post mortem human subjects were tested in frontal (5), oblique (2), side (2), and twist (1) scenarios at a nominal mini-sled velocity of 14 km/h for frontal, side, and oblique impacts and 1,800 deg/s for the twist scenario. Biomechanical responses of the head and lower neck were measured in various impact conditions.

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sex, loading rate, and age on the tensile material properties of human rib cortical bone over a wide range of subject demographics. Sixty-one (n\,=\,61) subjects (M\,=\,32, F\,=\,29) ranging in age from 17 to 99 years of age (Avg.\,=\,56.4\,{$\pm$}\,26.2\,yrs) were used in this study. Two rectangular coupons of cutaneous rib cortical bone were obtained from each subject and milled into dog-bone coupons for testing. For each subject, one coupon was tested to failure in tension on a material testing system at a targeted strain rate of 0.005 strain/s, while the other coupon was tested at 0.5 strain/s. A reaction load cell was used to measure axial load, and an extensometer was used to measure displacement within the gage length of the coupon. Data were obtained from fifty-eight (n\,=\,58) subjects at 0.005 strain/s and fifty-eight (n\,=\,58) subjects at 0.5 strain/s, with fifty-five (n\,=\,55) matched pairs. The elastic modulus, yield stress, yield strain, failure stress, failure strain, ultimate stress, elastic strain energy density (SED), plastic SED, and total SED were then calculated for each test. There were no significant differences in material properties between sexes and no significant interactions between age and sex. In regard to the differences in material properties with respect to loading rate, yield stress, yield strain, failure stress, ultimate stress, elastic SED, plastic SED, and total SED were significantly lower at 0.005 strain/s compared to 0.5 strain/s. Spearman correlation analyses showed that all material properties had significant negative correlations with age at 0.005 strain/s except modulus. At 0.5 strain/s, all material properties except yield strain had significant negative correlations with age. Although the results revealed that the material properties of human rib cortical bone varied significantly with respect to chronological age, the R2 values only ranged from 0.15 to 0.62, indicating that there may be other underlying variables that better account for the variance within a given population. This is the first study to analyze the effects of sex, loading rate, and age on tensile material properties of human rib cortical bone using a reasonably large sample size. Overall, the results of this study provide data that will allow FEMs to better model and assess differences in the material response of the rib cage for nearly all vehicle occupants of driving age.},

  abstract = {Cervical spinal injury and neck pain are common disorders with wide physical implications. Neck pain and disability are reported to occur in females more often than in males, and chronic or persistent neck pain after whiplash is twice as common in females. Female athletes also sustain a higher percentage of concussions compared to male athletes. Still, while sexual differences in clinical presentation and outcome are well-established, the underlying etiology for the disparity remains less clear. It is well-established that the origin and insertion landmarks of posterior neck muscles are highly variable, but we do not know if these interindividual differences are associated with sex. Expanding our knowledge on sexual dimorphism in the anatomy of the cervical muscles is essential to our understanding of the possible biomechanical differences between the sexes and hence improves our understanding as to why females suffer from cervical pain more than males. It is also of paramount importance for accurate planning of posterior cervical spine surgery, which cuts through the posterior cervical musculature. Therefore, our main objective is to characterize the anatomy of posterior neck musculature and to explore possible sexual differences in the location of their attachment points. Meticulous posterior neck dissection was performed on 35 cadavers, 19 females, and 16 males. In each specimen, 8 muscle groups were examined bilaterally at 45 osseous anatomical landmarks. Muscles and their attachment sites were evaluated manually then photographed and recorded using Microscribe Digitizer technology built into 3D models. A comparison of attachment landmarks between males and females for each muscle was conducted. Out of the eight muscles that were measured, only two muscles demonstrated significant sex-related anatomical differences\textemdash Spinotranversales (splenius capitis and cervicis) and Multifidus. Male Spinotransversales muscle has more attachment points than female. It showed more cranial insertion points in the upper cervical attachments (superior nuchal line, C1 posterior tubercle, and mastoid process) and more caudal insertion points in the spinous processes and transverse processes of the lower cervical and upper thoracic vertebrae. Thus, the male subjects in this study exhibited a greater coverage of the posterior neck both cranially and caudally. Female Multifidus has more attachment points on the spinous processes and articular processes at middle and lower cervical vertebrae and at the transverse processes of the upper thoracic vertebrae. All remaining muscles exhibited no sexual differences. Our findings highlight, for the first time, a sexual dimorphism in attachment points of posterior cervical musculature. It reinforces the notion that the female neck is not a scaled version of the male neck. These differences in muscle attachment could partially explain differences in muscle torque production and range of motion and thus biomechanical differences in cervical spine stabilization between sexes. It sheds a much-needed light on the reason for higher whiplash rates, concussion, and chronic cervical pain among females. Surgeons should take these sexual morphological differences into consideration when deliberating the best surgical approach for posterior cervical surgery.},

This study presents 117 human rib cortical bone coupon tests from six cadavers, three male and three female, ranging in age from 18 to 67 years old. The rib sections were taken from the anterior, lateral, and posterior regions on ribs 1 through 12 of each cadaver's rib cage. The cortical bone was isolated from each rib section with a low speed diamond saw, and milled into dog bone shaped tension coupons using a small computer numerical control machine. A high-rate servo-hydraulic Material Testing System equipped with a custom slack adaptor, to provide constant strain rates, was used to apply tension loads to failure at an average rate of 0.5 strains/sec. The elastic modulus, yield stress, yield strain, ultimate stress, ultimate strain, and strain energy density were determined from the resulting stress versus strain curves. The overall average of all cadaver data gives an elastic modulus of 13.9 GPa, a yield stress of 93.9 MPa, a yield strain of 0.88 \%, an ultimate stress of 124.2 MPa, an ultimate strain of 2.7 \%, and a strain energy density of 250.1 MPa-microstrain. For all cadavers, the plastic region of the stress versus strain curves was substantial and contributed approximately 60 \% to the strain energy and over 80 \% in the tests with the 18 year old cadaver. The rib cortical bone becomes more brittle with increasing age, shown by an increase in the modulus (p {$<$} 0.01) and a decrease in peak strain (p {$<$} 0.01). In contrast to previous three-bending tests on whole rib and rib cortical bone coupons, there were no significant differences in material properties with respect to rib region or rib level. When these results are considered in conjunction with the previous three-point bending tests, there is regional variation in the structural response of the human rib cage, but this variation appears to be primarily a result of changes in the local geometry of each rib while the material properties remain nearly constant within an individual.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to quantify both the tensile material properties and structural response of human ribs in order to determine which variables contribute to regional variation in the strength of human ribs. This was done by performing 94 matched tests on human rib specimens; 46 tension coupon tests, 48 three-point bending tests. Contralateral matched specimens were dissected from anterior and lateral regions of ribs 4 through 7 of six male fresh frozen post mortem human subjects ranging from 42 to 81 years of age. Tension coupons were taken from one side of the thorax, while three-point bending specimens were taken from the opposite side as the tension coupons at corresponding anatomical locations. The results of the tension coupon testing showed that there were no significant differences with respect to region or rib level: ultimate stress (p=0.90; p=0.53), ultimate strain (p=0.49; p=0.86), or modulus (p=0.72; p=0.81). In contrast, lateral three-point bending specimens were found to have a significantly higher peak bending moment (p{$<$}0.01), peak strain (p=0.03), modulus (p=0.05), and stiffness (p{$<$}0.01) than anterior specimens. The lateral three-point bending specimens also had a significantly larger area moment of inertia (p{$<$}0.01), larger distance to the neutral axis (p{$<$}0.01), smaller ratio of distance to the neutral axis to area moment of inertia (p{$<$}0.01), larger cortical bone area (p{$<$}0.01), and larger radius of gyration (p{$<$}0.01) than the anterior specimens. In addition, the peak moment (Ant p=0.20; Lat p=0.02), peak strain (Ant p=0.05; Lat p=0.15), and stiffness (Ant p{$<$}0.01; Lat p{$<$}0.01) were found to vary significantly with respect to rib level. Similar to anatomical region, the changes in the structural response with respect to rib level were also accompanied by significant changes in geometry. For anterior specimens, distance to the neutral axis (p{$<$}0.01), ratio of the distance to the neutral axis to area moment of inertia (p=0.02) and radius of gyration (p=0.04) were found to be significantly different with respect to rib level. For lateral specimens, the area moment of inertia (p{$<$}0.01), distance to the neutral axis (p{$<$}0.01), ratio of the distance to the neutral axis to area moment of inertia (p{$<$}0.01), the cortical bone area (p=0.01), and radius of gyration (p=0.03) were found to be significantly different with respect to rib level. These results clearly illustrate that there is variation in the structural response of human ribs with respect to anatomical region and rib level and this variation is due to changes in local geometry of each rib while the material properties remain constant.},

Two post-mortem human surrogates (PMHSs) (one male and one female) were instrumented with 26 single-axis strain gages on the ribs, sternum, and clavicle. The thorax of each PMHS was placed on a custom spine support bracket designed to support the thorax on either side of the spinous process, thereby allowing free motion at the costovertebral joints. In addition, the support bracket raised the thorax above the flat base plate, which could otherwise constrain the deformation and motion of the posterior region of the rib cage. The thorax of each PMHS was then loaded using a custom table-top belt loading system that generated thoracic displacement rates representative of a severe automotive collision, 1.3~m/s for the male PMHS and 1.0~m/s for the female PMHS. The rib fracture timing data, determined by analyzing the strain gage time histories, showed that severe thoracic injury (AIS~=~3) occurred at 16\% chest compression for the male and 12\% chest compression for the female. However, these values are well below the current thoracic injury criteria of 29\% chest compression for the male and 23\% chest compression for the female. This data illustrates that serious thoracic injury (AIS~=~3) occurs at lower chest compressions than the current ATD thoracic injury criteria. Overall, this study provides critical data that can be used in the design and validation of advanced ATDs and finite element models, as well as the establishment of improved, more stringent thoracic injury criteria.},

  abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to obtain non-censored rib fracture data due to three-point belt loading during dynamic frontal post-mortem human surrogate (PMHS) sled tests. The PMHS responses were then compared to matched tests performed using the Hybrid-III 50th percentile male ATD.Methods: Matched dynamic frontal sled tests were performed on two male PMHSs, which were approximately 50th percentile height and weight, and the Hybrid-III 50th percentile male ATD. The sled pulse was designed to match the vehicle acceleration of a standard sedan during a FMVSS-208 40 kph test. Each subject was restrained with a 4 kN load limiting, driver-side, three-point seatbelt. A 59-channel chestband, aligned at the nipple line, was used to quantify the chest contour, anterior-posterior sternum deflection, and maximum anterior-posterior chest deflection for all test subjects. The internal sternum deflection of the ATD was quantified with the sternum potentiometer. For the PMHS tests, a total of 23 single-axis strain gages were attached to the bony structures of the thorax, including the ribs, sternum, and clavicle. In order to create a non-censored data set, the time history of each strain gage was analyzed to determine the timing of each rib fracture and corresponding timing of each AIS level (AIS = 1, 2, 3, etc.) with respect to chest deflection.Results: Peak sternum deflection for PMHS 1 and PMHS 2 were 48.7 mm (19.0\%) and 36.7 mm (12.2\%), respectively. The peak sternum deflection for the ATD was 20.8 mm when measured by the chest potentiometer and 34.4 mm (12.0\%) when measured by the chestband. Although the measured ATD sternum deflections were found to be well below the current thoracic injury criterion (63 mm) specified for the ATD in FMVSS-208, both PMHSs sustained AIS 3+ thoracic injuries. For all subjects, the maximum chest deflection measured by the chestband occurred to the right of the sternum and was found to be 83.0 mm (36.0\%) for PMHS 1, 60.6 mm (23.9\%) for PMHS 2, and 56.3 mm (20.0\%) for the ATD. The non-censored rib fracture data in the current study (n = 2 PMHS) in conjunction with the non-censored rib fracture data from two previous table-top studies (n = 4 PMHS) show that AIS 3+ injury timing occurs prior to peak sternum compression, prior to peak maximum chest compression, and at lower compressions than might be suggested by current PMHS thoracic injury criteria developed using censored rib fracture data. In addition, the maximum chest deflection results showed a more reasonable correlation between deflection, rib fracture timing, and injury severity than sternum deflection.Conclusions: Overall, these data provide compelling empirical evidence that suggests a more conservative thoracic injury criterion could potentially be developed based on non-censored rib fracture data with additional testing performed over a wider range of subjects and loading conditions.},

We believe this is the first study to quantify the force-deflection response of the same thorax to different loading conditions using dynamic, non-impact, restraint-like loading. Subjects were positioned supine on a table and a hydraulic master-slave cylinder arrangement was used with a high-speed materials testing machine to provide controlled chest deflection at a rate similar to that experienced by restrained PMHS in a 48-km/h sled test. All loading conditions were tested at a nominally non-injurious level initially. When the battery of non-injurious tests was completed, a single loading condition was used for a final, injurious test (nominal 40\% chest deflection). To minimize the influence of repeated testing, all subjects were preconditioned prior to each loading condition using 10 cycles of a 1-Hz sine wave, and the order in which the loading conditions were tested was varied across subjects. Thoracic response was characterized using the deflection at the midline of the sternum and a load cell mounted between the subject and the loading table. Responses were defined by cross-plotting the mid-sternal deflection (normalized to 50(th) male) and the posterior force (scaled to a 45-year-old, 50(th) male based on size and modulus) and then forming a +/-1-standard-deviation corridor that considered the variance in both force and deflection. Corridors were developed to a deflection level of 20\% of the 50(th) percentile male's external chest depth. The distributed loading condition generated the stiffest response (3.33 kN at 4.6 cm), followed by the double diagonal belt condition (3.18 kN at 4.6 cm), the single diagonal belt (2.28 kN at 4.6 cm) and the hub (1.14 kN at 4.6 cm).},

  abstract = {Crash protection for an aging population is one of the primary drivers of contemporary passive safety research, yet estimates of the potential benefit of age-optimized systems have not been reported. This study estimates the number killed and injured in traffic crashes due to the age-related reduction in tolerance to loading. A risk-saturation model is developed and calibrated using 2000\textendash 2007 data for the age distribution of crash-involved adult occupants and drivers and the number of those injured and killed in 2006. Nonlinear functions describing the relationships between age and risk, adjusted for several confounders are developed using 10 years of NASS-CDS data and considered along with published risk functions for both mortality and injury. The numbers killed and injured as a result of age-related fragility and frailty are determined by setting the risk at all ages equal to the risk at age 20 (i.e., risk is assumed to ``saturate'' at age 20). The analysis shows that risk saturation at age 20 corresponds to 7,805\textendash 14,939 fewer driver deaths and 10,989\textendash 21,132 fewer deaths to all occupants. Furthermore, 1.13\textendash 1.32 million fewer occupants would be injured (0.80\textendash 0.93 million fewer drivers) per year. In other words, that number of deaths and injuries can be attributed to age-related reductions in loading tolerance. As the age of risk saturation increases, the benefit decreases, but remains substantial even in the age regime typically considered ``elderly''. For example, risk saturation at age 60 corresponds to 1,011\textendash 3,577 fewer deaths and 73,537\textendash 179,396 fewer injured occupants per year. The benefit of risk saturation is nearly log-linear up to approximately age 70, but drops off quickly thereafter due to the low exposures in the oldest age range. The key contribution of this study is the quantification of deaths and injuries that can be attributed to aging and the development of functions describing the relationship between age of risk saturation and the number of deaths and injuries averted.},

The two models can be linked together to simulate head and neck motion during a vehicular crash. Details of each model are provided along with a short history of the development. The models were validated against available experimental data conducted on cadavers. For the brain injury model, predictions of relative displacement of the brain with respect to the skull are compared with experimentally derived data using a bi-axial high-speed x-ray machine. The tests were carried out on cadaveric heads and were blunt impacts to the occipital region of the head. The neck model was validated against data from two sets of experiments. It was able to simulate with reasonably accurate kinematics crown impacts to the head and rearend collisions. The paper discusses the availability of the models to the biomechanical community, their strengths and deficiencies as well as future directions for improved models. It is concluded that sophisticated finite element models are useful tools for the study of the biomechanics of injury, if the models have been properly validated. There is, however, a continuing need to obtain more data on the material properties of the tissues that make up the head and neck and to go to a finer mesh to extract a more detailed response from the model. More experimental data are being obtained from this laboratory so that the models can be validated against a larger volume of experimental data.},

  abstract = {The objective of the present study was to analyze the effect of different load directions and durations following impact using a finite element (FE) model of the human head. A detailed FE model of the human head was developed and validated against available cadaver experiment data for three impact directions (frontal, occipital, and lateral). Loads corresponding to the same impact power were imposed in different directions. Furthermore, the head injury criterion (HIC), the recently proposed head impact power (HIP) criterion, as well as peak angular acceleration, and change in angular and translational velocity were evaluated with respect to the strain in the central nervous system (CNS) tissue. A significant correlation was found between experiments and simulations with regard to intracranial pressure data for a short-duration impulse and intracerebral acceleration characteristics for a long-duration impulse with a high-angular component. However, a poor correlation with the simulations was found for the intracranial pressures for the long-duration impulse. This is thought to be a result of air introduced to the intracranial cavity during experimental testing. Smaller relative motion between the brain and skull results from lateral impact than from a frontal or occipital blow for both the experiments and FE simulations. It was found that the influence of impact direction had a substantial effect on the intracranial response. When evaluating the global kinematic injury measures for the rotational pulses, the change in angular velocity corresponded best with the intracranial strains found in the FE model. For the translational impulse, on the other hand, the HIC and the HIP showed the best correlation with the strain levels found in the model.},

  abstract = {In the Euro NCAP testing of deployable pedestrian protection systems (i.e. active bonnets and airbags), head impact time (HIT), wrap around distance and bonnet deflection due to body loading are assessed by means of simulations with numerical pedestrian models. The aim of this study was to define requirements for numerical pedestrian models and simulation setups to ensure comparable performance of models and simulation results. These requirements were summarized in a certification procedure which focuses on the pedestrian's kinematics that are important for the Euro NCAP assessment. Twelve different institutions (academia and industry) applied a harmonised pedestrian simulation protocol, which was established within a previous study. Numerical pedestrian models in the stature of the 50th percentile male (all applicable for the assessment of deployable systems until 2017) were impacted with four differently shaped generic vehicle models at three different collision speeds according to the protocol. Trajectories, contact forces and HITs were evaluated. Finally, 18 full data sets including the 12 load cases were available covering different Human Body Models and Humanoid Multibody Models in four different FE codes. Reference values, corridors and tolerances for the certification procedure were derived, based on identified consistent results. Comparable behaviour was observed for the majority of pedestrian models. However, a small number of simulations showed clearly outlying behaviour in terms of HITs, trajectories and contact forces. The consistent models were within a range of +3.5\% and -7\% throughout all load cases. Corridors for the z- and x- trajectories as a function of time were developed for the head centre of gravity, T12 and the centre of acetabuli for each load case. Furthermore, corridors for the contact forces between pedestrian model and generic vehicle model were established. The developed certification procedure ensures that a specific pedestrian model within a specific environment, solver version and specific simulation settings gives comparable kinematic results relevant for the assessment of deployable systems. Inconsistent pedestrian models, incompatibilities with control settings and user errors can be identified and sorted out. The procedure was implemented in the Euro NCAP Technical Bulletin 24 and has been in force since January 2018.},

The report was translated in all major world languages. Deane and Dennis Meadows have shown that the existing exponential growth of population, the use of resources and the growing air pollution cannot continue in a limited world. It was the first global warning for humankind that the continuation of resource use and energy wastage of the industrial society cannot be sustainable. Radical changes in the system were recommended, but not accepted by politicians, narrow-minded experts and the society. If politicians would have been sensitive to this report and would have changed their policy, a sustainable future of the globe would have been possible after 1972. But this did not happen. Today, we know that there is no sustainable future for the human society any more. The global system is in a state of overshoot and collapse. Professor Dennis Meadows explained in many lectures and publications that changes in the next 20\textendash 30 years will be much bigger than the changes we had during the last 100 years. The humankind of today lives in a world outside the carrying capacity of the globe. The ecological footprint as an indicator for human activities is 30\% over the carrying capacity of the globe.},

Finite element (FE) models of the proximal femur may help in the assessment of patients at high risk for a hip fracture. However, extensive validation is essential before these models can be used in a clinical setting. This study aims to use strain measurements from bilateral digital image correlation to validate an FE model against ex vivo experimental data of proximal femora under a sideways fall loading condition. For twelve subjects, full-field strain measurements were available on the medial and lateral side of the femoral neck. In this study, subject-specific FE models were generated based on a consolidated procedure previously validated for stance loading. The material description included strain rate dependency and separate yield and fracture strain limits in tension and compression. FE predicted fracture force and experimentally measured peak forces showed a strong correlation (R2~=~0.92). The FE simulations predicted the fracture initiation within 3~mm distance of the experimental fracture line for 8/12 subjects. The predicted and measured strains correlated well on both the medial side (R2~=~0.87) and the lateral side (R2~=~0.74). The lower correlation on the lateral side is attributed to the irregularity of the cortex and presence of vessel holes in this region. The combined validation against bilateral full-field strain measurements and peak forces has opened the door for a more elaborate qualitative and quantitative validation of FE models of femora under sideways fall loading.},

  abstract = {In this work we introduce a manifold learning-based method for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in systems describing complex spatiotemporal processes. Our first objective is to identify the embedding of a set of high-dimensional data representing quantities of interest of the computational or analytical model. For this purpose, we employ Grassmannian diffusion maps, a two-step nonlinear dimension reduction technique which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify meaningful geometric descriptions in a parsimonious and inexpensive manner. Polynomial chaos expansion is then used to construct a mapping between the stochastic input parameters and the diffusion coordinates of the reduced space. An adaptive clustering technique is proposed to identify an optimal number of clusters of points in the latent space. The similarity of points allows us to construct a number of geometric harmonic emulators which are finally utilized as a set of inexpensive pre-trained models to perform an inverse map of realizations of latent features to the ambient space and thus perform accurate out-of-sample predictions. Thus, the proposed method acts as an encoder-decoder system which is able to automatically handle very high-dimensional data while simultaneously operating successfully in the small-data regime. The method is demonstrated on two benchmark problems and on a system of advection-diffusion-reaction equations which model a first-order chemical reaction between two species. In all test cases, the proposed method is able to achieve highly accurate approximations which ultimately lead to the significant acceleration of UQ tasks.},

  abstract = {Constructing surrogate models for uncertainty quantification (UQ) on complex partial differential equations (PDEs) having inherently high-dimensional O(10n), n{$\geq$}2, stochastic inputs (e.g., forcing terms, boundary conditions, initial conditions) poses tremendous challenges. The ``curse of dimensionality'' can be addressed with suitable unsupervised learning techniques used as a pre-processing tool to encode inputs onto lower-dimensional subspaces while retaining its structural information and meaningful properties. In this work, we review and investigate thirteen dimension reduction methods including linear and nonlinear, spectral, blind source separation, convex and non-convex methods and utilize the resulting embeddings to construct a mapping to quantities of interest via polynomial chaos expansions (PCE). We refer to the general proposed approach as manifold PCE (m-PCE), where manifold corresponds to the latent space resulting from any of the studied dimension reduction methods. To investigate the capabilities and limitations of these methods we conduct numerical tests for three physics-based systems (treated as black-boxes) having high-dimensional stochastic inputs of varying complexity modeled as both Gaussian and non-Gaussian random fields to investigate the effect of the intrinsic dimensionality of input data. We demonstrate both the advantages and limitations of the unsupervised learning methods and we conclude that a suitable m-PCE model provides a cost-effective approach compared to alternative algorithms proposed in the literature, including recently proposed expensive deep neural network-based surrogates and can be readily applied for high-dimensional UQ in stochastic PDEs.},

Additionally, the heights of the neighboring vertebral bodies were measured, and the prediction of the disc heights based only on the size of the vertebral bodies was investigated. The anterior (ADH), middle (MDH) and posterior heights (PDH) of the discs were measured directly and on radiographs of 72 spine segments from 30 donors (age 57.43 {$\pm$} 11.27 years). The radiographic measurement error and the reliability of the measurements were calculated. Linear and non-linear regression analyses were employed for investigation of statistical correlations between the heights of the thoracic disc and vertebrae. Radiographic measurements displayed lower repeatability and were shorter than the anatomical ones (approximately 9\% for ADH and 37\% for PDH). The thickness of the discs varied from 4.5 to 7.2 mm, with the MDH approximately 22.7\% greater. The disc heights showed good correlations with the vertebral body heights (R2, 0.659\textendash 0.835, P-values {$<$} 0.005; anova), allowing the generation of 10 prediction equations. New data on thoracic disc morphometry were provided in this study. The generated set of regression equations could be used to predict thoracic disc heights from radiographic measurement of the vertebral body height posterior. For the creation of parameterized models of the human thoracic discs, the use of the prediction equations could eliminate the need for direct measurement on intervertebral discs. Moreover, the error produced by radiographic measurements could be reduced at least for the PDH.},

  abstract = {Since the 1970s, many biofidelity targets for the thorax in frontal impact have been proposed for both dummy and finite element (FE) model application. This paper proposes an update using three test configurations: impactor, sled with a 3-point belt restraint and table top. For the impactor configuration, an extensive Post Mortem Human Subject (PMHS) test database was constituted using both recent and old tests. The considered responses were the impactor force versus thoracic external deflection. The normalization process was updated using a mass-spring model. Recent published methods were used to exclude outliers and pool the PMHS tests into consistent samples. For the sled configuration, a recent test series of 8 PMHS subjected to the same impact conditions was chosen. The considered responses were the shoulder belt tension versus time and the deflection versus time of 5 points at the anterior wall of the ribcage in the X, Y and Z directions. The responses were normalized using a mass-based technique. Interpolation of missing portions of signals were performed for some tests. The T8 vertebra was chosen to define the thoracic coordinate system. The average PMHS response curve plus and minus one standard deviation was proposed as a biofidelity target for both the impactor and sled configurations. The table top configuration was considered in order to develop a biofidelity target for a distributed loading condition. A recent test series that used both distributed and diagonal belt loading conditions was chosen. To account for the limitations of this test configuration with respect to a real car crash, only the force values at 20\% of thoracic compression were taken and were used relatively to the diagonal belt loading.},

  abstract = {Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue, affecting millions of people annually. Anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) and finite element models (FEMs) provide a means of understanding factors leading to TBI, potentially reducing the occurrence. Thus, there is a need to ensure that these tools accurately model humans. For example, the Hybrid III was not based on 3-dimensional human head shape data. The objective of this study is to produce average head and skull contours for an average U.S. male that can be used for ATDs and FEMs. Methods: Computed tomography (CT) scans of adult male heads were obtained from a database provided by the University of Virginia Center for Applied Biomechanics. An orthographic viewer was used to extract head and skull contours from the CT scans. Landmarks were measured graphically using HyperMesh (Altair, HyperWorks). To determine the head occipital condyle (OC) centroid, surface meshes of the OCs were made and the centroid of the surfaces was calculated. The Hybrid III contour was obtained using a MicroScribe Digitizer (Solution Technologies, Inc., Oella, MD). Comparisons of the average male and ATD contours were performed using 2 methods: (1) the midsagittal and midcoronal ATD contours relative to the OC centroid were compared to the corresponding 1 SD range of the average male contours; (2) the ATD sagittal contour was translated relative to the average male sagittal contour to minimize the area between the 2 contours. Results: Average male head and skull contours were created. Landmark measurements were made for the dorsum sellae, nasion skin, nasion bone, infraorbital foramen, and external auditory meatus, all relative to the OC centroid. The Hybrid III midsagittal contour was outside the 1 SD range for 15.2 percent of the average male head contour but only by a maximum distance of 1.5 mm, whereas the Hybrid III midcoronal head contour was outside the 1 SD range for 12.2 percent of the average male head contour by a maximum distance of 2 mm. Minimization of the area between the midsagittal contours resulted in only 2.3 mm of translation, corroborating the good correlation between the contours established by initial comparison. Conclusions: Three-dimensional average male head and skull contours were created and measurements of landmark locations were made. It was found that the 50th percentile male Hybrid III corresponds well to the average male head contour and validated its 3D shape. Average adult head and skull contours and landmark data are available for public research use at http://biomechanics.pratt.duke.edu/data.},

  abstract = {Traffic safety technologies revolve around two principle ideas; crash avoidance and injury mitigation for inevitable crashes. The development of relevant vehicle injury mitigating technologies should consider the interaction of those two technologies, ensuring that the inevitable crashes can be adequately managed by the occupant and vulnerable road user (VRU) protection systems. A step towards that is the accurate description of the expected crashes remaining when crash-avoiding technologies are available in vehicles. With the overall objective of facilitating the assessment of future traffic safety, this study develops a method for predicting crash configurations when introducing crash-avoiding countermeasures. The predicted crash configurations are one important factor for prioritizing the evaluation and development of future occupant and VRU protection systems. By using real-world traffic accident data to form the baseline and performing counterfactual model-in-the-loop (MIL) pre-crash simulations, the change in traffic situations (vehicle crashes) provided by vehicles with crash-avoiding technologies can be predicted. The method is built on a novel crash configuration definition, which supports further analysis of the in-crash phase. By clustering and grouping the remaining crashes, a limited number of crash configurations can be identified, still representing and covering the real-world variation. The developed method was applied using Swedish national- and in-depth accident data related to urban intersections and highway driving, and a conceptual Autonomous Emergency Braking system (AEB) computational model. Based on national crash data analysis, the conflict situations Same-Direction rear-end frontal (SD-ref) representing 53 \% of highway vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) crashes, and Straight Crossing Path (SCP) with 21 \% of urban v2v intersection crashes were selected for this study. Pre-crash baselines, for SD-ref (n = 1010) and SCP (n = 4814), were prepared based on in-depth accident data and variations of these. Pre-crash simulations identified the crashes not avoided by the conceptual AEB, and the clustering of these revealed 5 and 52 representative crash configurations for the highway SD-ref and urban intersection SCP conflict situations, respectively, to be used in future crashworthiness studies. The results demonstrated a feasible way of identifying, in a predictive way, relevant crash configurations for in-crash testing of injury prevention capabilities.},

  abstract = {Car passengers are frequently sitting in non-nominal postures and are able to perform a wide range of activities since they are not limited by tasks related to vehicle control, contrary to drivers. The anticipated introduction of Autonomous Driven vehicles could allow ``drivers'' to adopt similar postures and being involved in the same activities as passengers, allowing them a similar set of non-nominal postures. Therefore, the need to investigate the effects of non-nominal occupant sitting postures during relevant car crash events is becoming increasingly important. This study aims to investigate the effect of different postures of passengers in the front seat of a car on kinematic and kinetic responses during intersection crashes. A Human Body Model (HBM) was positioned in a numerical model of the front passenger seat of a midsize Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) in a total of 35 postures, including variations to the lower and upper extremities, torso, and head postures. Three crash configurations, representative of predicted urban intersection crashes, were assessed in a simulation study; two side impacts, a near-side and a far-side, respectively, and a frontal impact. The occupant kinematics and internal loads were analyzed, and any deviation between the nominal and altered posture responses were quantified using cross-correlation of signals to highlight the most notable variations. Posture changes to the lower extremities had the largest overall influence on the lower extremities, pelvis, and whole-body responses for all crash configurations. In the frontal impact, crossing the legs allowed for the highest pelvis excursions and rotations, which affected the whole-body response the most. In the two side-impacts, leaning the torso in the coronal plane affected the torso and head kinematics by changing the interaction with the vehicle's interior. Additionally, in far-side impacts supporting the upper extremity on the center console resulted in increased torso excursions. Moreover, the response of the upper extremities was consistently sensitive to posture variations of all body regions.},

  abstract = {A key technical issue for human intention prediction from observed human actions is how to discover and utilize the spatio-temporal patterns behind those actions. Inspired by the well-known two-stream architecture for action recognition, this paper proposes an approach for human intention prediction based on a two-stream architecture using RGB images and optical flow. Firstly, the action-start frame of each trial of a human action is determined by calculating the L2 distance of the positions of the human joints between frames of the skeleton data. Secondly, a spatial network and a temporal network are trained separately to predict human intentions using RGB images and optical flow, respectively. Both early concatenation fusion methods in the spatial network and sampling methods in the temporal network are optimized based on experiments. Finally, average fusion is used to fuse the prediction results from the spatial network and the temporal network. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a new dataset of human intentions behind human actions is introduced. This dataset contains RGB images, RGB-D images, and skeleton data of human actions of pitching a ball. Experiments show that the proposed approach can predict human intentions behind human actions with a prediction accuracy of 74\% on the proposed dataset. The proposed approach is further evaluated on the Intention from Motion (IfM) dataset, a dataset of human intentions behind human actions of grasping a bottle. The proposed approach achieves a prediction accuracy of 77\% on the IfM dataset. The proposed approach is effective in predicting human intentions behind human actions in different applications.},

Understanding biomechanical contributors to skull deformation would provide further insight into the mechanism of head injury resulting from blunt trauma. In particular, skull thickness is thought be a very important factor governing deformation of the skull and its propensity for fracture. Current computed tomography (CT) technology is limited in its ability to accurately measure cortical thickness using standard techniques. A method to evaluate cortical thickness using cortical density measured from CT data has been developed previously. This effort validates this technique for measurement of skull table thickness in clinical head CT scans using two postmortem human specimens. Bone samples were harvested from the skulls of two cadavers and scanned with microCT to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated cortical thickness measured from clinical CT. Clinical scans were collected at 0.488 and 0.625 mm in plane resolution with 0.625 mm thickness. The overall cortical thickness error was determined to be 0.078 {$\pm$} 0.58 mm for cortical samples thinner than 4 mm. It was determined that 91.3\% of these differences fell within the scanner resolution. Color maps of clinical CT thickness estimations are comparable to color maps of microCT thickness measurements, indicating good quantitative agreement. These data confirm that the cortical density algorithm successfully estimates skull table thickness from clinical CT scans. The application of this technique to clinical CT scans enables evaluation of cortical thickness in population-based studies.},

Understanding biomechanical contributors to skull deformation would provide further insight into the mechanism of head injury resulting from blunt trauma. In particular, skull thickness is thought be a very important factor governing deformation of the skull and its propensity for fracture. Previously, age- and sex-based skull cortical thickness changes were difficult to evaluate based on the need for cadaveric skulls. In this cross-sectional study, skull thickness changes with age and sex have been evaluated at homologous locations using a validated cortical density-based algorithm to accurately quantify cortical thickness from 123 high-resolution clinical computed tomography (CT) scans. The flat bones of the skull have a sandwich structure; therefore, skull thickness was evaluated for the inner and outer tables as well the full thickness. General trends indicated an increase in the full skull thickness, mostly attributed to an increase in the thickness of the diploic layer; however, these trends were not found to be statistically significant. There was a significant relationship between cortical thinning and age for both tables of the frontal, occipital, and parietal bones ranging between a 36\% and 60\% decrease from ages 20 to 100 years in females, whereas males exhibited no significant changes. Understanding how cortical and full skull thickness changes with age from a wide range of subjects can have implications in improving the biofidelity of age- and sex-specific finite element models and therefore aid in the prediction and understanding of TBI from impact and blast injuries. \textcopyright{} 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

Normalizing mechanical properties by disc geometry allows for such comparisons, but there is little consistency in the methods by which disc geometry is measured. As such, we hypothesized that methods used to measure disc geometry would impact reported mechanical properties. Disc height and area were measured using computed tomography (CT), digital calipers, and ImageJ to yield three different measurements for disc height and six for disc area. Disc heights measured by digital calipers ex situ were {$>$}30\% less than disc heights measured in situ by CT, and disc areas measured ex situ using ImageJ were {$>$}30\% larger than those measured by CT. This significantly affected reported mechanical properties, leading to a 65\% reduction in normalized compressive stiffness in the most extreme case. Though we cannot quantitatively correct between methods, results presented in this study suggest that disc geometry measurement methods have a significant impact on normalized mechanical properties and should be accounted for when comparing results.},

In order to enable car manufacturers and road safety regulators to safeguard that females benefit equally from crash safety measures as males, it is necessary to develop new dedicated occupant models. These new models must represent the female part of the population, i.e. crash test dummies and human body models representing the average female. New female models would, together with their male equivalents, make it possible to identify the vehicle occupant safety systems which provide the best safety features for both females and males.},

Due to the extremely soft nature of brain tissue, its mechanical characterization is challenging. The response to loading depends on length and time scales and is characterized by nonlinearity, compression-tension asymmetry, conditioning, and stress relaxation. In addition, the regional heterogeneity\textendash both in mechanics and microstructure\textendash complicates the comprehensive understanding of local tissue properties and its relation to the underlying microstructure. Here, we combine large-strain biomechanical tests with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and develop an extended type of constitutive artificial neural networks (CANNs) that can account for viscoelastic effects. We show that our viscoelastic constitutive artificial neural network is able to describe the tissue response in different brain regions and quantify the relevance of different cellular and extracellular components for time-independent (nonlinearity, compression-tension-asymmetry) and time-dependent (hysteresis, conditioning, stress relaxation) tissue mechanics, respectively. Our results suggest that the content of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin is highly relevant for both the quasi-elastic behavior and viscoelastic effects of brain tissue. While the quasi-elastic response seems to be largely controlled by extracellular matrix proteins from the basement membrane, cellular components have a higher relevance for the viscoelastic response. Our findings advance our understanding of microstructure - mechanics relations in human brain tissue and are valuable to further advance predictive material models for finite element simulations or to design biomaterials for tissue engineering and 3D printing applications.}

Trunk cross-sectional images adopted from the Visible Human male project database were segmented into fat, bone, and lean tissue. Assuming that all male subjects have similar cross-sectional composition at a given body height percentile, areas of the segmented cross-sectional images of the Visible Human male along the trunk were scaled to match those of the predicted body shape. The trunk mass distribution of the target subject can then be computed using the density values of fat, bone, and lean tissue. Comparison of the predicted body shape circumference with ground truth values measured using digital and actual measurements yielded maximum mean error of 13.3~mm and 30.3~mm, respectively. The accuracy of the image segmentation was evaluated, and the results showed a high Jaccard index ({$>$}0.95). The proposed method was able to predict the trunk mass distribution of two volunteers with a maximum deviation of 384~g at T4 level and a minimum deviation of 12~g at L4 level and the corresponding centers of mass fell within the experimental data at most levels. Thus, our method can be considered as a feasible option to calculate subject-specific trunk mass distribution.},

  abstract = {Part I \textemdash{} Biomechanics Response Data \textemdash{} Thoracic impact response data for unembalmed human cadavers previously published by three of the authors are reviewed. These data are then ``averaged,'' adjusted to reflect an estimate for muscle tensing, and used as the basis for recommended force-deflection corridors to serve as dummy design guidelines. A volunteer study of muscle tensing, as related to thoracic stiffness at low force and deflection levels, is discussed, and comments are made concerning additional response data recently acquired by other investigators. Finally, consideration is given to possible ``second order'' refinements for future generations of a high fidelity dummy thorax. Part II \textemdash{} Response of Current Dummy Chests \textemdash The chest structures of five currently available dummies were evaluated for blunt impact force-deflection response. Testing was conducted in essentially the same manner as was used to acquire the cadaver data of Part I. The resulting force-deflection characteristics were then compared with the GMR recommended performance corridors. In all cases, the existing structures were found to develop excessive resisting forces at deflection levels beyond 3/4 inch, clearly indicating the need for an improved design. Part III \textemdash{} Mathematical Model for Thoracic Impact \textemdash A mathematical model has been developed which simulates the dynamic force-deflection response of the human thorax under blunt impact. The model consists of four differential equations derived from a mechanical thoracic analog formed from springs, masses, and dashpots. Equation parameters were adjusted to give desired responses. It was found that when parameters were set to give responses correlating closely with cadaver data previously published by three of the authors, the model response also correlated well with The University of Michigan HSRI cadaver data when the proper impact conditions were used. The model was used to show the relationship between various types of blunt thoracic impact and for dummy thorax design.},

  abstract = {Objective: Although the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) was initially developed in the mid-1960s for tracking injury in automotive and aircraft crashes, it has grown to become an internationally recognized scoring system for a variety of traumatic injuries. This shift in focus and advances in organized medical care, combined with feedback from field use and outcome analysis, have resulted in several AIS updates and revisions. This article demonstrates how AIS codes and severities have changed over the last 25 years and investigates the effects of those changes.Methods: Data from each version and update of the AIS dictionary (AIS 1990, AIS 1998, AIS 2005, AIS 2008, and AIS 2015) were analyzed for changes and shifts in injury descriptions, severities, and code counts.Results: The number of AIS codes has increased to improve coding specificity and reliability for a growing number of injury types. There has also been a shift in severities, mainly within the moderate (AIS 2) to severe (AIS 4) range. AIS 1990 was the first version to utilize the 6-digit predot identifier, to add modifiers for pediatric injury, and to substantially expand brain injury codes. AIS 1998 added coding rules and guidelines throughout the dictionary and integrated the Organ Injury Scale scores. The AIS 2005 dictionary added over 400 codes and made significant changes throughout. Fewer changes were made in the AIS 2008 update. AIS 2015 includes descriptions for tissue injuries with loss of soft tissue that do not qualify as amputations, a need identified in military injury analysis.Conclusions: Each updated version of AIS reflects improving medical care and new advances in understanding, measuring, and documenting injury. AIS changes over time reflect its international and cross-domain utilization for describing injury severity and set the standard for how the world now studies traumatic injury.},

The same models were also manually segmented (Mimics, version 17.01, Materialise, Leuven, Belgium) and set as ground truth. The accuracy of semi-automatic segmentation was evaluated by (1) comparing the volume of each semi-automatic 3D rendered condylar model with that obtained with manual segmentation, (2) deviation analysis of each 3D rendered mandibular models with those obtained from manual segmentation. No significant differences were found in the volumetric dimensions of the condylar models among the tested software (p {$>$} 0.05). However, the color-coded map showed underestimation of the condylar models obtained with ITK-Snap and Slicer 3D, and overestimation with Dolphin 3D and Invesalius. Excellent reliability was found for both intra-observer and inter-observer readings. Despite the excellent reliability, the present findings suggest that data of condylar morphology obtained with semi-automatic segmentation should be taken with caution when an accurate definition of condylar boundaries is required.},

  abstract = {Given the high incidence of TBI, head injury has been studied extensively using both cadavers and anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs). However, few studies have benchmarked the response of ATD heads against human data. Hence, the objective of this study is to investigate the response of adult and ATD heads in impact, and to compare adult Hybrid III head responses to the adult head responses. In this study, six adult human heads and seven ATD heads were used to obtain impact properties. The heads were dropped from both 15cm and 30cm onto five impact locations: right and left parietal, forehead, occiput and vertex. One set of drops were performed on the human heads and up to four sets were carried out on the ATD heads. For each drop, the head was placed into a fine net and positioned to achieve the desired drop height and impact location. The head was then released to allow free fall without rotation onto a flat aluminum 34 -inch thick platen. The platen was attached to a three-axis piezoelectric load cell to measure the impact force. The peak resultant acceleration, head impact criterion (HIC) and impact stiffness were calculated using the force/time curve and drop mass. No statistical differences were found between the adult human heads and the adult Hybrid III head for 15cm and 30cm impacts (p{$>$}0.05). For the human heads, the mid-sagittal impact locations produced the highest HIC and peak acceleration values. The parietal impacts produced HICs and peak accelerations that were 26\textendash 48\% lower than those from the mid-sagittal impacts. For the ATD heads, the acceleration and HIC values generally increased with represented age, except for the Q3, which produced HIC values up to higher than the other ATD heads. The impact responses of the adult Hybrid III onto different impact locations were found to adequately represent the impact stiffness of human adult head impacts from 30cm and below onto a rigid surface. The Q3 dummy consistently produced the highest HIC values of the ATD heads, and produced higher acceleration and HIC values than the adult human heads as well, which is contrary to neonatal data demonstrating that the head acceleration increases with age.},

Currently available models of the human neck are designed primarily for application in automotive crash testing, and their applicability in assessment of helmets is often questioned. The object of the present work is to document the mechanical design, repeatability, and biofidelity in low speed impact of a new neck model that we apply with a Hybrid III head. Focusing on Hybrid III head kinematics measured during impacts at 2 to 6 m/s, the co-efficient of variance of repeated measures of kinematics was generally less than 10\%. Differences in kinematics between identical copies of the neck was less than 20\% when tested with helmets, and less than 7\% when the head was not helmeted. In parallel testing using a Hybrid III head-neck, the co-efficient of variance in repeated measures was less than 4\% and the kinematics significantly differed from those measured using the new neck. CORAplus scores for the new neck were approximately 0.70 when compared against data for human subjects with passive neck muscles experiencing impact at 2 m/s.},

Objective.~         This study aimed to establish cervical spine morphometry, alignment, and range of motion (ROM) and to clarify the impact of these age-related and degenerative changes.         Summary of Background Data.~         There are no studies that have evaluated differences in the results of cervical spine radiographs between a large series of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) patients and healthy subjects.         Methods.~         We enrolled 1016 consecutive CSM patients who underwent laminoplasty. CSM patients were also divided based on each decade of life between the fourth and ninth decades. We also enrolled a total of 1230 healthy volunteers as asymptomatic subjects in this study. There were at least 100 men and 100 women in each decade of life between the third and eighth decades. Cervical sagittal alignment on neutral and flexion-extension views was measured by the Cobb method at C2\textendash 7. ROM was assessed by measuring the difference in alignment between flexion and extension.         Results.~         Cervical lordosis in the neutral position increased gradually with age in both groups. CSM patients showed significantly smaller lordotic angles compared with those shown by asymptomatic subjects within each decade. The total ROM decreased with increasing age in both groups. The total ROM of females was larger than males. The ROM of CSM patients was significantly smaller than asymptomatic subjects. The flexion ROM did not change with aging in either group. There was no significant difference in the flexion ROM between males and females in the two groups. However, the extension ROM decreased gradually in both groups. The extension ROM of CSM patients was significantly smaller than asymptomatic subjects.         Conclusion.~         Age-related and degenerative changes in the cervical spine, alignment, and ROM in each decade of life were established between CSM patients and asymptomatic subjects.

  abstract = {SummaryThis paper begins with a brief review of the development of crash investigation techniques from the 1950s to the present day. Early work at Cornell University in the United States led to studies in Australia, Sweden and the United Kingdom and a general recognition of the fundamental importance of a detailed knowledge of the nature and circumstances of actual trauma to traffic accident victims. Today a number of countries have on-going structured sample date collection programmes which provide an important means of assessing the effectiveness of biomechanical advances which are implemented through changing car design and regulations. Notably, the NASS/FARS programmes in the United States, by being freely available electronically, have become a valuable source to other countries.Such research illustrates an important yet still poorly understood aspect of impact biomechanics; that of variation within the population at risk. Examples are given of this issue in terms of head, neck, thoracic, leg and abdominal injury studies to show that a factor of three exists between the weakest and strongest elements of the normal population exposed to impact injury. Age and gender effects are discussed.The optimisation of protection recognising the two distributions of crash severity and impact tolerance variations leads to the conclusion that focusing on very severe collisions does not result in good overall protection. The links with experimental biomechanics are illustrated and the paper concludes with proposals for new research directions with increasingly detailed instrumentation of vehicles and more realistic modelling of the human frame.},

While finite element (FE) models of the human brain are important tools to understand and mitigate TBI, many unresolved issues remain that need to be addressed to improve these models. This work aims to provide readers with background information regarding the current state of research in this field as well as to present recent advancements made possible by improvements to computational resources. Specifically, this has manifested as a drive to introduce more details in FE models in the form of increased spatial resolution and improved material models such as nonlinear and anisotropic constitutive models. The need to work with high-resolution FE meshes is underlined by the dominant wavelengths involved in transient pressure and shear wave propagation and the ability to model the brain surface. We also discuss improvements to experimental validation techniques which allow for better calibrated models. We review these recent developments in detail, highlighting their contributions to the field as well as identifying open issues where more research is needed.},

This approach imparts more sophistication to the numerical model and yields results that more closely match experimental results. It is found that the peak pressure more closely matches the experiments as compared to the heterogeneous case. Qualitatively, we find differences in stress wave propagation near the corpus callosum and the corona radiata, which are stiffer on average than the global white matter. We are able to study the effects of these stiff structures on transient stress wave propagation within the cerebrum, something that cannot be done with a homogenized material model.},

  abstract = {Background: Structural changes within the proximal humerus influence the mechanical properties of the entire bone and predispose to low-energy fractures with complex patterns. The aim of the present study was to measure the cortical thickness in different regions of the proximal humerus. Methods: Thirty-seven proximal humeri were analyzed using novel engineering software to determine cortical thickness in 10 distinct anatomical zones. Results: The cortical thickness values ranged from 0.33\,mm to 3.5\,mm. Fifteen specimens demonstrated a consistent pattern of progressive cortical thinning that increased between the bicipital groove (thickest), the lesser tuberosity and the greater tuberosity (thinnest). Fifteen humeri were characterized by a progressive increase in cortical thickness between the greater tuberosity (thinnest), the bicipital groove and lesser tuberosity (thickest). The diaphysis exhibited the thickest cortical zone in 27 specimens, whereas the articular surface possessed the thinnest cortex in 18 cases. Conclusions: In conclusion, this is the first study to comprehensively assess cortical thickness of the humeral head. Our findings suggest that proximal humeral fractures occur along lines of cortical thinning and are displaced by the hard glenoid bone. The identification of specific areas of thick cortices may improve pre-operative planning and optimize fracture fixation.},

  abstract = {Given that automobile crashes are the largest single cause of death for pregnant females, scientists are developing advanced computer models of pregnant occupants. The purpose of this study is to quantify the dynamic material properties of the human uterus in order to increase the biofidelity of these models. A total of 19 dynamic tension tests were performed on pregnant human uterus tissues taken from six separate donors. The tissues were collected during full term Cesarean style deliveries and tested within 36h of surgery. The tissues were processed into uniform coupon sections and tested at 1.5strains/s using linear motors. Local stress and strain were determined from load data and optical markers using high speed video. The experiments resulted in a non-linear stress versus strain curves with an overall average peak failure true strain of 0.32{$\pm$}0.112 and a corresponding peak failure true stress of 656.3{$\pm$}483.9kPa. These are the first data available for the dynamic response of pregnant human uterus tissues, and it is anticipated they will increase the accuracy of future pregnant female computational models.},

  abstract = {Diffuse brain injuries resulting from non-impact rotational acceleration are investigated with the aid of physical models of the skull-brain structure. These models provide a unique insight into the relationship between the kinematics of head motion and the associated deformation of the surrogate brain material. Human and baboon skulls filled with optically transparent surrogate brain tissue are subjected to lateral rotations like those shown to produce diffuse injury to the deep white matter in the brain of the baboon. High-speed cinematography captures the deformations of the grids embedded within the surrogate brain tissue during the applied load. The overall deformation pattern is compared to the pathological portrait of diffuse brain injury as determined from animal studies and autopsy reports. Shear strain and pathology spatial distributions mirror each other. Load levels and resulting surrogate brain tissue deformations are related from one species to the other. Increased primate brain mass magnified the strain amplified without significantly altering the spatial distribution. An empirically-derived value for a critical shear strain associated with the onset of severe diffuse axonal injury in primates is determined, assuming constitutive similarity between baboon and human brain tissue. The primate skull physical model data and the critical shear strain associated with the threshold for severe diffuse axonal injury were used to scale data obtained from previous studies to man, and thus derive a diffuse axonal injury tolerance for rotational acceleration for humans.},

  abstract = {Objective: Serious head and cervical spine injuries have been shown to occur mostly independent of one another in pure rollover crashes. In an attempt to define a dynamic rollover crash test protocol that can replicate serious injuries to the head and cervical spine, it is important to understand the conditions that are likely to produce serious injuries to these 2 body regions. The objective of this research is to analyze the effect that impact factors relevant to a rollover crash have on the injury metrics of the head and cervical spine, with a specific interest in the differentiation between independent injuries and those that are predicted to occur concomitantly.Methods: A series of head impacts was simulated using a detailed finite element model of the human body, the Total HUman Model for Safety (THUMS), in which the impactor velocity, displacement, and direction were varied. The performance of the model was assessed against available experimental tests performed under comparable conditions. Indirect, kinematic-based, and direct, tissue-level, injury metrics were used to assess the likelihood of serious injuries to the head and cervical spine.Results: The performance of the THUMS head and spine in reconstructed experimental impacts compared well to reported values. All impact factors were significantly associated with injury measures for both the head and cervical spine. Increases in impact velocity and displacement resulted in increases in nearly all injury measures, whereas impactor orientation had opposite effects on brain and cervical spine injury metrics. The greatest cervical spine injury measures were recorded in an impact with a 15\textdegree{} anterior orientation. The greatest brain injury measures occurred when the impactor was at its maximum (45\textdegree ) angle.Conclusions: The overall kinetic and kinematic response of the THUMS head and cervical spine in reconstructed experiment conditions compare well with reported values, although the occurrence of fractures was overpredicted. The trends in predicted head and cervical spine injury measures were analyzed for 90 simulated impact conditions. Impactor orientation was the only factor that could potentially explain the isolated nature of serious head and spine injuries under rollover crash conditions. The opposing trends of injury measures for the brain and cervical spine indicate that it is unlikely to reproduce the injuries simultaneously in a dynamic rollover test.},

We demonstrate FCI's utility by investigating in detail the resulting disabling injuries and their life year costs.Methods: We selected occupants in the 2000\textendash 2013 NASS-CDS database involved in frontal and side crashes, merged their injuries with FCI, and then used the merged data to estimate each occupant's overall functional loss. Lifetime functional loss was assessed by combining this measure of impairment with the occupants' expected future life spans, estimated from the Social Security Administration's Actuarial Life Table.Results: Frontal crashes produce a large number of disabling injuries, particularly to the lower extremities. In our population, these crashes are estimated to account for approximately 400,000 life years lost to disability in comparison with 500,000 life years lost to fatality. Victims of side crashes experienced a higher rate of fatality but a significantly lower rate of disabling injury (0.3 vs. 1.0\%), resulting in approximately 370,000 life years lost to fatality versus 50,000 life years lost to disability.Conclusions: The burden of disabling injuries to car crash survivors should be considered when setting vehicle safety design priorities. In frontal crashes this burden in life years is similar to the burden attributable to fatality.},

  abstract = {Objective: Automated driving systems (ADS) are actively being deployed within the driving fleet. ADS are designed to safely navigate roadways, which entails an expectation of encountering varying degrees of potential conflict with other road users. The ADS design and evaluation process benefits from estimating injury severity probabilities for collisions that may occur. Current regression models in the literature are typically bespoke analyses involving targeted principal directions of force (PDOFs) and occupant positions. It is preferable to rely on injury severity models derived from a single source to provide a continuous function of risk for all planar collisions, while also accounting for specific vehicle and occupant characteristics. The novel feature of the proposed models is continuous, parametric injury risk surfaces that encompass the full spectrum of available United States field data.Methods: We used years 2001\textendash 2015 of the National Automotive Sampling System, Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS) and years 2017\textendash 2019 of the Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS) to estimate injury risk at the maximum abbreviated injury scale (MAIS) 3 and higher (3+) and 5 and higher (5+) levels for all adult occupants traveling in 2002 or newer passenger vehicles which were less than 10 years old at the time of the crash. The models account for occupant, vehicle, and crash characteristics. Interactions with vulnerable road users (e.g., pedestrian, bicyclist) were not considered.Results: We present statistical models suitable to predict injury in all non-rollover crashes at the maximum MAIS3+ and 5+ levels, and show that these models can be comparable to similar single scenario (e.g., frontal) crash models. We discuss challenges with imputing missing field data, and discuss handling of covariates that may not be known at the time of the crash.Conclusions: Collision severity assessment is a vital component of the ADS design process. We developed a novel injury risk function that can assess occupant injury risks across the spectrum of foreseeable planar collisions. These models can provide insight on potential outcomes of counterfactual simulations, injury risk and crashworthiness considerations for human driven vehicles, and provide an evaluation tool that can be applied in ADS safety impact evaluation.},

Finite element models of the human head are used widely to simulate TBI loading scenarios, to improve the understanding of the mechanical pathogenesis of head trauma. The reliability of such computational models depends strongly on the accuracy of the mechanical properties of the different components of the brain. Here, we address the shortage of high-quality data on the region-specific properties of human brain tissue at dynamic rates and under large deformation. We mechanically characterized 12 different regions of the human brain including cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem through n=595 force-relaxation experiments with a custom-built micro-indentation apparatus. We imposed up to 35\% strain at 10/s strain rate, i.e. values representative for TBI. Pronounced differences in mechanical response were observed across the brain. This work both highlights and addresses the need to assign accurate, region-specific viscoelastic properties to different brain regions in finite element head models.},

  abstract = {Advanced neck finite element modeling and development of neck injury criteria are important for the design of optimal neck protection systems in automotive and other environments. They are also important in virtual tests. The objectives of the present study were to develop a detailed finite element model (FEM) of the human neck and couple it to the existing head model, validate the model with kinematic data from legacy human volunteer and human cadaver impact datasets, and derive lateral impact neck injury risk curves using survival analysis from the upper and lower neck forces and moments. The detailed model represented the anatomy of a young adult mid-size male. It included all the cervical and first thoracic vertebrae, intervening discs, upper and lower spinal ligaments, bilateral facet joints, and passive musculature. Material properties were obtained from literature. Frontal, oblique, and lateral impacts to the distal end of the model was applied based on human volunteer and human cadaver experimental data. Corridor and cross-correlation methods were used for validation. The CORrelation and Analysis (CORA) score was used for objective assessments. Forces and moments were obtained at the occipital condyles (OC) and T1, and parametric survival analysis was used to derive injury risk curves to define human neck injury tolerance to lateral impact. The Brier Score Metric (BSM) was used to determine the hierarchical sequence among the injury metrics. The CORA scores for the lateral, frontal, and oblique impact loading conditions were 0.80, 0.91, and 0.87, respectively, for human volunteer data, and the mean score was 0.7 for human cadaver lateral impacts. Injury risk curves along with {$\pm$}95\% confidence intervals are given for all the four biomechanical metrics. The OC shear force was the optimal metric based on the BSM. A force of 1.5~kN was associated with the 50\% probability level of AIS3+ neck injury. As a first step, the presented risk curves serve as human tolerance criteria under lateral impact, hitherto not available in published literatures, and they can be used in virtual testing and advancing restraint systems for improving human safety.},

  abstract = {In innervated collagenous tissues, tissue scale loading may contribute to joint pain by transmitting force through collagen fibers to the embedded mechanosensitive axons. However, the highly heterogeneous collagen structures of native tissues make understanding this relationship challenging. Recently, collagen gels with embedded axons were stretched and the resulting axon signals were measured, but these experiments were unable to measure the local axon strain fields. Computational discrete fiber network models can directly determine axon strain fields due to tissue scale loading. Therefore, this study used a discrete fiber network model to identify how heterogeneous collagen networks (networks with multiple collagen fiber densities) change axon strain due to tissue scale loading. In this model, a composite cylinder (axon) was embedded in a Delaunay network (collagen). Homogeneous networks with a single collagen volume fraction and two types of heterogeneous networks with either a sparse center or dense center were created. Measurements of fiber forces show higher magnitude forces in sparse regions of heterogeneous networks and uniform force distributions in homogeneous networks. The average axon strain in the sparse center networks decreases when compared to homogeneous networks with similar collagen volume fractions. In dense center networks, the average axon strain increases compared to homogeneous networks. The top 1\% of axon strains are unaffected by network heterogeneity. Based on these results, the interaction of tissue scale loading, collagen network heterogeneity, and axon strains in native musculoskeletal tissues should be considered when investigating the source of joint pain.},

  abstract = {This open access book provides a broad context for the understanding of current problems of science and of the different movements aiming to improve the societal impact of science and research. The author offers insights with regard to ideas, old and new, about science, and their historical origins in philosophy and sociology of science, which is of interest to a broad readership. The book shows that scientifically grounded knowledge is required and helpful in understanding intellectual and political positions in various discussions on the grand challenges of our time and how science makes impact on society. The book reveals why interventions that look good or even obvious, are often met with resistance and are hard to realize in practice. Based on a thorough analysis, as well as personal experiences in aids research, university administration and as a science observer, the author provides - while being totally open regarding science's limitations- a realistic narrative about how research is conducted, and how reliable `objective' knowledge is produced. His idea of science, which draws heavily on American pragmatism, fits in with the global Open Science movement. It is argued that Open Science is a truly and historically unique movement in that it translates the analysis of the problems of science into major institutional actions of system change in order to improve academic culture and the impact of science, engaging all actors in the field of science and academia.},

  abstract = {Background Changes in sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume may contribute to neck-related concussion symptoms and whiplash-associated disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data on healthy SCM morphology can provide information that may lead to targeted treatment protocols. Objectives To examine sex-related differences in MRI-based SCM CSA, SCM volume and neck area in healthy young adults, to analyze associations between measurements and participant variables and to assess inter-rater reliability for measurement quantification. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods 13 males and 14 females underwent MRI scans. Slices obtained from C3\textendash C7 were analyzed by three raters. SCM CSA at C4, total SCM volume from C3\textendash C7 and neck area at C4 were quantified. Measurements were calculated as absolute and normalized values by body mass. Multivariable regression was used to analyze associations between normalized measurement values and participant variables. Inter-rater reliability was determined using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Results Females had significantly lower normalized overall average SCM CSA (mean difference 1.3~mm2/kg (95\% CI 0.4\textendash 2.2, p~=~0.006) and total SCM volume (mean difference 140.8 mm3/kg (95\% CI 66.1\textendash 215.5, p~{$<~$}0.001) than males. Regression models indicated female sex was associated with lower normalized overall average SCM CSA (p~=~0.004) and total SCM volume (p~{$<~$}0.001). Inter-rater reliability was excellent for SCM CSA (ICC3,3~=~0.909), SCM volume (ICC3,3~=~0.910) and neck area (ICC3,3~=~0.995). Conclusions These results enhance our understanding of sex-related differences in SCM morphology and will inform future research and clinical practice related to cervical muscle injury.},

  abstract = {Enforcement of traffic rules and regulations forms an important component of strategies to reduce deaths and injuries due to road traffic crashes. As with many other issues concerning road safety policy, it is not always clear whether common sense approaches in police enforcement actually reduce injuries and fatalities on the road. It is therefore important to assess whether a given enforcement measure, though seemingly beneficial in its intent, actually results in any reduction of delinquent behaviour of drivers and number of crashes. In this article, we assess the evidence base of effectiveness of on-road enforcement measures by conducting a review of systematic reviews on this topic. In this review, we focused only on the objective police programmes or strategies and excluded the reviews which assessed the effectiveness of a traffic enforcement law. We answer the following questions in this review: (a) what is the theoretical basis of different enforcement measures? (b) What are the different road safety enforcement measures for which evidence is available in systematic reviews and how current is this evidence? (c) What are the different limitations or drawbacks of different studies as reported by the systematic reviews and what are their implications on results? (d) What are the different factors which limit the generalisations of available evidence across different settings or across different types of modes? Our review suggests that: (i) legislation and enforcement are effective when violations are visible and easy to detect. (ii) Strict punishment not as effective as subjective perception of being caught violating a law. (iii) There is an absence of studies that could provide guidelines on police enforcement for low and middle-income countries on the following issues: (a) influence of road and infrastructure design on traffic violations and the difficulties of enforcement when designs are not adequate for the kind and volume of road users present; (b) critical/minimum levels of enforcement necessary for different traffic violations; (c) enforcement methods that would be cost effective in situations with high proportion of motorcycles and other vulnerable road users.},

  abstract = {Background:~         The purpose of this study was to define the variability in skull thickness from location to location and from individual to individual in a large number of human skulls.         Method:~         Skull thickness was measured in multiple areas of the calvaria in 281 dry skulls from the Hamman-Todd osteological collection (Cleveland Museum of Natural History, Cleveland, Ohio). A total of 40 points were determined over the frontal, occipital, and parietal bones, with a higher number of points concentrated on the latter. Repeated measures analysis of variance models were used to assess the effects of covariates (individual variables) on skull thickness and location.         Result:~         A statistically significant pattern of increased thickness toward the posterior parietal bones was seen in all subgroups. The mean thickness of the skull across all locations was 6.32 mm (SEM, 0.07 mm) and ranged from 5.3 mm (SEM, 0.09 mm) to 7.5 mm (SEM, 0.09 mm). Age was not found to be a significant predictor of mean skull thickness. Differences between male and female skulls were greater toward the rear of the parietal bones.         Conclusion:~         The thickest area of the skull is the parasagittal posterior parietal area in male skulls and the posterior parietal area midway between the sagittal and superior temporal line in female skulls. An accurate map of the skull thickness representing the normative data of the studied population was developed. It is hoped that this topographic map will assist the surgeons in choosing the safest area of cranial bone graft harvest, thus increasing the safety of the procedure.},

  abstract = {OBJECT Safe and effective insertion of occipital bone screws requires morphological analysis of the occipital bone, which is poorly documented in the literature. The authors of this study present morphological data for determining the area of screw placement for optimal internal fixation. METHODS The subjects of this institutional review board-approved retrospective study were 105 individuals without head and neck disease who underwent CT imaging at the authors' hospital. There were 55 males and 50 females, with a mean age of 57.1 years (range 20\textendash 91 years). Measurements using CT were taken according to a matrix of 55 points following a grid with 1-cm spacing based on the external occipital protuberance (EOP). RESULTS The maximum thickness of the occipital bone was at the level of the EOP at 16.4 mm. Areas with thicknesses {$>$} 8 mm were more frequent at the EOP and up to 2 cm in all directions, as well as up to 1 cm in all directions at a height of 1 cm inferiorly, and up to 3 cm from the EOP inferiorly. The male group tended to have a thicker occipital bone than the female group, and the differences were significant around the EOP. The ratio of the trabecular bone to the occipital bone thickness was {$>$} 30\% in the central region. At positions more than 2 cm laterally, the ratio was {$<$} 15\%, and the ratio gradually decreased further laterally. CONCLUSIONS Screws that are 8 mm long can be placed in the area extending 2 cm laterally from the EOP at the level of the superior nuchal line and approximately 3 cm inferior to the center. These results suggest that it may be possible to effectively insert a screw over a wider area than the conventional reference range.},

These helmets must satisfy a wide range of impact velocities from ballistic impacts to blunt impacts. In this paper, we analyze European Regulation ECE R22.05 using a standard surrogate head and a human head model to evaluate combat helmet performance. Two critical parameters on traumatic brain analysis are studied for different impact locations, i.e., peak linear acceleration value and head injury criterion (HIC). The results obtained are compared with different injury criteria to determine the severity level of damage induced. Furthermore, based on different impact scenarios, analyses of the influence of impact velocity and the geometry impact surface are performed. The results show that the risks associated with a blunt impact can lead to a mild traumatic brain injury at high impact velocities and some impact locations, despite satisfying the different criteria established by the ECE R22.05 standard. The results reveal that the use of a human head for the estimation of brain injuries differs slightly from the results obtained using a surrogate head. Therefore, the current combat helmet configuration must be improved for blunt impacts. Further standards should take this into account and, consequently, combat helmet manufacturers on their design process.},

To numerically study the lap belt-pelvis interaction, biofidelic representation of subcutaneous adipose tissue appears essential, especially for obese occupants with a thick layer of adipose tissue. Therefore, in this study, a finite element model is constructed and a newly developed material model for adipose tissue from the previous work is implemented to study the mechanism of lap belt-pelvis interaction and how subcutaneous adipose tissue affects this. Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is used to determine which aspects of the mechanical properties of adipose tissue play a major role in the lap belt-pelvis interaction. It is found that, firstly, the incompressibility condition of adipose tissue is the most influential parameter. Secondly, the nonlinear elastic and viscoelastic properties are influential because of experiencing large deformation. The findings of this study are meaningful for vehicular injury-oriented characterization of adipose tissue as well as improving the biofidelity of finite element human body models for human safety.},

  abstract = {The chest impact data of Kroell, et al., and Stalnaker, et al., were examined to determine the relationships that might exist between the physical characteristics of cadavers, impact conditions, and responses. It was found that while the Kroell male, Kroell female, and Stalnaker data had similar physical characteristics, their responses were not related to their physical characteristics and impact conditions in the same manner. Regression equations were found that fit the Kroell male data extremely well. Based on a regression analysis of the Kroell male data, scaling rules were developed that allowed performance requirements for chest response to be defined for 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile dummies. Previous response requirements were for 50th percentile dummies only and were based on averaged responses from subjects whose average characteristics differed widely from 50th percentile characteristics. Currently recommended response corridors based on an extended data base are presented in the Addendum. The extended data base includes new data being concurrently published. These additional data produce a few minor changes in the response corridors, while improving their statistical significance.}

This necessitates a need to quantify and manage the injury risks on the human body in terms of the different vehicular impact variables and their associated uncertainties for different crash scenarios. In this chapter, we present a decision-based robust design framework to quantify and manage the head impact-based injury risks on occupants for different model-based car crash scenarios. The key functionality offered is the designer's capability to carry out robust design studies with a focus on managing the selected impact variables and associated uncertainties such that brain injury risks are controlled within acceptable levels. The efficacy of the framework is tested for driver's side impact scenarios with impact velocity and angle of impact as the critical variables of interest. Two head injury criteria, namely, head injury criterion and neck injury criterion are selected to quantitatively measure the head and neck injury risks in crash simulations. Using the framework, a robust design problem is formulated to explore the combination of impact variables that best satisfice the injury goals defined. The framework and associated design constructs are generic and support the formulation and decision-based robust design of vehicle impact scenarios for managing injury risks.},

  abstract = {SummaryDuring the latter half of this century biomechanics has made an enormous impact on medicine and biology. As with virtually all of bioengineering, this started with applying existing knowledge of mechanics to problems in biology and medicine. In more recent years this has evolved to where there is a true integration between the engineering mechanics and the biology. This integration has resulted in not only the application of mechanics to problems which could not even be envisioned 40 years ago, but also has resulted in the development of the field of mechanics itself. There are at least three biomedical areas where biomechanics has had a major impact. These are cardiovascular dynamics, orthopaedics, and injury biomechanics. In all three of these areas the focus has shifted from the macroscopic to the microscopic, i.e. to molecular and cellular biomechanics. A relatively recent emerging area is that of tissue engineering, i.e. the development of biological substitutes for implantation into the body. This field is truly at the interface of the traditional medical implant industry and the biotechnology industry. It offers the possibility of implants which will have greater patency. As we move in the 21st century, the human genome project will be virtually complete. In this post-genomic era one will move from the genome to the proteome and ultimately to the physiome. The information that will be associated with this will be extensive and to the point where proper interpretation will only be possible if adequate computational models of the dynamics of biological processes can be developed. These models need to extend all the way from the regulation of gene expression to the physiological function of tissues and organs. Finally, the development of the educational programs which truly integrate biology and engineering must be a priority if we are to have the manpower needed for the future. These are the opportunities and challenges for the 21st century, ones to which the biomechanics community can make important contributions.},

  abstract = {Objective Age is often used as a predictor of injury and mortality in motor vehicle crashes (MVCs), however, the age that defines an ``older'' occupant in terms of injury-risk remains unclear, as do specific injury patterns associated with increasing age. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between age and serious injury (including injury patterns) for occupants involved in MVCs. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study using a national population-based cohort of adult front-seat occupants involved in MVCs and included in the National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System database from 1995 to 2006. The primary outcome was serious injury, defined as an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) score {$\geq$}3 in any body region. Anatomic injury patterns were also assessed by age. Results One hundred thousand one hundred and fifty-six adult front-seat occupants were included in the analysis, of which 14,128 (2\%) were seriously injured. Age was a strong predictor of serious injury using a variety of different age covariates (categorical, continuous, and polynomial) in multivariable regression models (p{$<$}0.0001 for all). There was evidence of a strong non-linear relationship between age and serious injury (p{$<$}0.001 for comparison of non-linear to linear representation of age). There was no age that clearly defined an ``older'' occupant by injury risk, as the odds of injury increased with increasing age across all age groups. The proportion of serious head and extremity injuries gradually increased with increasing age, while serious chest injuries markedly increased after 60 years. Conclusions Age is a strong predictor of serious injury from motor vehicle trauma, the risk of which increases in non-linear fashion as age increases. There is no specific age that clearly defines an ``older'' occupant by injury risk.},

It is important to understand the major causes of motorcycle crash severity to suggest effective countermeasures. There have been studies elsewhere examining factors related to small-displacement motorcycle crash severity, but work in Vietnam is scarce. This study uses ordinal logistic regression to investigate contributory factors to the odds of severe crashes involving motorcycle riders. A distinction is made between crashes where motorcyclists are involved as the second party (i.e., as victims of the crash) on the one hand and as the first party (i.e., as the person responsible for causing the crash) on the other hand. Results show that age and gender of the first party person, size of the vehicle collided with, and presence of a pillion passenger significantly contribute to the severity of crashes in which motorcyclists are involved as the second party. Significant factors to the severity of crashes in which motorcyclists are involved as the first party are age, time of the crash, road class, size of the second party vehicle, pillion passenger presence, and riding speed. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of fatal crashes with small-displacement motorcycles in a developing city. This study helps to identify countermeasures to improve road safety of small-displacement motorcycle riders.},

An additional objective is to evaluate the relative strength and flexibility of the upper and lower cervical spine in an effort to better understand injury mechanisms, and to provide quantitative data on bending responses and failure modes. Pure moment flexibility and failure testing was conducted on 52 female spinal segments in a pure-moment test frame. The average moment at failure for the O-C2 segments was 23.7+/-3.4Nm for flexion and 43.3+/-9.3Nm for extension. The ligamentous upper cervical spine was significantly stronger in extension than in flexion (p=0.001). The upper cervical spine was significantly stronger than the lower cervical spine in extension. The relatively high strength of the upper cervical spine in tension and in extension is paradoxical given the large number of upper cervical spine injuries in out-of-position airbag deployments. This discrepancy is most likely due to load sharing by the active musculature.},

  abstract = {New vehicle safety standards are designed to limit the amount of neck tension and extension seen by out-of-position motor vehicle occupants during airbag deployments. The criteria used to assess airbag injury risk are currently based on volunteer data and animal studies due to a lack of bending tolerance data for the adult cervical spine. This study provides quantitative data on the flexion-extension bending properties and strength on the male cervical spine, and tests the hypothesis that the male is stronger than the female in pure bending. An additional objective is to determine if there are significant differences in stiffness and strength between the male upper and lower cervical spine. Pure-moment flexibility and failure testing was conducted on 41 male spinal segments (O-C2, C4-C5, C6-C7) in a pure-moment test frame and the results were compared with a previous study of females. Failures were conducted at approximately 90 N-m/s. In extension, the male upper cervical spine (O-C2) fails at a moment of 49.5 (s.d. 17.6)N-m and at an angle of 42.4 degrees (s.d. 8.0 degrees). In flexion, the mean moment at failure is 39.0 (s.d. 6.3 degrees) N-m and an angle of 58.7 degrees (s.d. 5.1 degrees). The difference in strength between flexion and extension is not statistically significant. The difference in the angles is statistically significant. The upper cervical spine was significantly stronger than the lower cervical spine in both flexion and extension. The male upper cervical spine was significantly stiffer than the female and significantly stronger than the female in flexion. Odontoid fractures were the most common injury produced in extension, suggesting a tensile mechanism due to tensile loads in the odontoid ligamentous complex.},

  abstract = {Pedestrian safety is an issue in many urbanized areas throughout the world. While this is recognized by policymakers, many tend to focus more on traffic congestion and finding solutions to improve traffic flow. These two objectives are often in conflict in urban areas. This paper outlines the early history of this conflict in Great Britain and the USA leading up to the development of engineering guidelines focused on improving traffic flow and the level of service in cities, guidelines that are replicated in many developing countries. New safety manuals are being developed and some of the flaws with these are also highlighted, primarily that they tend to ignore behavioral adaptation that can occur in response to safety policies. This is followed by a review of research examining safety trends and policies that have successfully reduced fatalities. This research also suggests that the construction of large arterial and collector roads is counterproductive, despite the recommendations in engineering guidance. Pedestrian casualties and their severity are then discussed, with findings that show that larger, high-speed roads tend to result in more severe injuries and that various features of urban environments are beneficial for pedestrian safety. Various problems with the data available for conducting this type of analysis, especially pedestrian fatality data, make the rigorous tracking of such information problematic. Solutions to improving traffic and pedestrian safety are then highlighted, including shared space concepts, complete streets, and road diets that reduce the flow of traffic. A cost/benefit analysis of a road diet is evaluated showing that for the case studied, the safety benefits are overwhelmingly positive, with only minor costs associated with extra traffic delay. In closing, the implications for rapidly developing countries are briefly discussed with a warning not to follow the path of some western countries.},

The software serves as both a user-ready toolbox that includes many of the latest methods for UQ in computational modeling and a convenient development environment for Python programmers advancing the field of UQ. The paper presents an introduction to the software's architecture and existing capabilities, divided in the code in a set of modules centered around different UQ tasks such as sampling methods, generation of random processes and random fields, probabilistic inverse modeling, reliability analysis, surrogate modeling, and active learning. The paper also highlights the importance of the RunModel module, which is used to drive simulations in the uncertainty analyses performed in UQpy. This module conveniently allows the user to define computational models directly in Python, or to run simulations from a third-party software in serial or in parallel. To illustrate the various capabilities, two examples are tracked throughout the paper and analyzed repeatedly for various UQ tasks. The first is a Python model solving a nonlinear structural dynamics problem, used to illustrate UQpy's capabilities in sampling and forward propagation of high dimensional random vectors (stochastic processes), and probabilistic inference. The second model is a third-party Abaqus finite element model solving the thermomechanical response of a beam structure. This example is used to illustrate UQpy's capabilities in variance reduction sampling techniques, reliability analysis, surrogate modeling and active learning techniques.},

The present study evaluates the effect on occupant kinematics and restraint interaction using a protection strategy in which the occupant is repositioned back to an upright position prior to a frontal impact, through simulations with an Active Human Body Model. The seat-back repositioning was beneficial in that it achieved similar head kinematics during crash as in an upright initial position. Submarining of the occupant pelvis under the lap-belt was not avoided as the pelvis did not return fully to upright due to the flexibility of the lumbar spine of the HBM. The study also revealed that repositioning could be achieved by the occupant's own torso inertia during pre-crash braking as well as by moving the seat-back. Comparison of simulations with both active and passive HBM showed that the active muscles could potentially influence the crash consequence predictions from the HBM.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an overview of achievements in the safety benefits (lives extended and injuries mitigated) provided by current or close-to-market vehicle technologies. It also proposes to review some of the research and developments in future vehicle safety such as connected vehicles and automated driving. It finally discusses expected safety benefits, and potentials as well as barriers to a large dissemination of these current and future technology-based traffic safety measures. As they are mostly foreseen in high income countries in the middle term, another type of revolution is needed in low and middle income countries for before these technologies can be put onto all global markets at a reasonable cost and contribute to the safety benefits of all road users. Frugal safety, coming from the frugal engineering concept, would be the recommended way to enable and accelerate this deployment. As for vehicle safety technologies already on the market, they have proven to be highly effective in mitigating vehicle occupant injuries, and injuries of vulnerable road users. Secondary safety devices and basic driver assistance systems have been largely evaluated and the effectiveness of seat belts, load limiters, pretensioners, airbags, car structure, electronic stability control (ESC), emergency brake assist (EBA) and other such devices have been examined. Available results show that, for example, if all cars were Euro NCAP five stars and fitted with EBA and ESC, compared to four stars without ESC and EBA, injury accidents would be reduced by 47\%, all injuries would be mitigated by 68\% and severe + fatal injuries by 70\% (Page et al. in 53th AAAM conference, Baltimore, 2009). Unlike secondary safety systems, ESC, ultrasonic park assist, cornering lights and manual speed limiters, most of the primary safety systems or advanced assistance systems (such as blind spot detection, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, automated cruise control, night vision and high speed AEB) are not, or just poorly, deployed on the market. There are a few reasons for this. First, their maturity and their capacity to work well without too many counter effects are recent, technological barriers have been strong for a long time. They were launched first in luxury cars in the USA, Japan and Western Europe in the mid-2000s and democratization has started just a few years back. Secondly, these features are costly, in terms of unit price and also in terms of investment; and their deployment demands progress in cost reduction. Thirdly, their expected safety benefits are, to a certain extent, not really known. If it is now epidemiologically demonstrated that secondary safety features bring safety, as well as ESC, the positive effectiveness of not yet largely deployed primary safety devices is only estimated and not yet proven, except for some of them like low speed automatic emergency braking (AEB). Studies about effectiveness of these devices take into account the potential in saving lives of generic functions, but a lot is still unknown about the real-world usage and acceptance by drivers and pedestrians of these applications. As there are many variants of these features, and especially concerning the mode of restitution to the driver of the information, the alert, or the warnings, the genuine efficiency of each variant is still a mystery. Of course, in-house studies by suppliers and car manufacturers anticipate positive acceptance by drivers and have identified and countered possible counter effects. Of course, current research is evaluating their potential to safety and in covering real-world driver needs, but a large field of research is still open for their safety assessment in real-life. Anyhow, the introduction of vehicle safety technologies is supposed to bring safety for a variety of road users and a variety of crash configurations. Of course, they will first be disseminated in high income countries but they will also be further disseminated, expectedly quickly, in the rest of the world under the pressure of customer demand, competition between vehicle makers as well as pressure from all kinds of New Car Assessment Programs, NCAP's (Latin NCAP in South America, Bharat NCAP in India, Asian NCAP in Asia, etc.), and more generally from Global NCAP, which federates NCAP's all over the world. This will be a first step in the globalization of existing or close-to-development vehicle safety technologies. Now, further on, emerging (more complex) technologies such as connectivity (vehicle-to-X communications) and automated driving will bring additional opportunities to tackle road crashes by adding safety applications not yet covered by passive safety or traditional (advanced) assistance systems. Actually connected technologies for safety and driving assistance systems in the current world of stand-alone technologies have three additional values: Improve the robustness of current systems by enhancing/duplicating capabilities and functionalities. Replace existing systems at a lesser cost. Add new functionalities to current ones and then expand the potential of coverage of various crash configurations and risk factors. For example, the EU-funded Drive C2X has selected 9 applications that are mainly safety-related (most of them address the so-called risk awareness issue, i.e., a crucial information needed by users and preventing them from a potential road hazard. The danger does not require an immediate action from the driver but requires an increase in attention and situation consciousness), but that can have also an impact on efficiency, mobility and the environment. Furthermore, the automated driving allows some kind of delegation of driving tasks from the driver to the system, from partial delegation (e.g., lateral control in congested traffic) to full automation (driver out of the loop or even out of the vehicle). Even though the technologies are not really fully reliable and robust, automated cars are largely experimented with in the USA (and not only the much-publicized Google or Tesla cars), in Europe and in Japan and are presented as the future of the automobile. These cars are expected to bring extremely large safety benefits when the technologies are mature and the driver errors eradicated. Finally, frugal safety is a concept that helps in identifying ways to reduce dramatically the costs of technologies, both in the devices themselves and in the process to produce the devices and their integration in the vehicles. Examples of vehicle-to-X technologies, automated driving functions and frugal safety devices illustrate our discussion about the promises of such technological revolutions. They are expected to highly contribute to crash and injury reductions to an extent never achieved by traditional safety measures so far.},

A finite element (FE) model corresponding to a 5th percentile female pedestrian (F05-PS) was developed by morphing the Global Human Body Models Consortium (GHBMC) 50th percentile male pedestrian (M50-PS) model to the reconstructed geometry of a recruited small female subject. The material properties of the pedestrian model were assigned based on GHBMC M50-PS model. In model validation, the knee lateral stiffness and force time histories of F05-PS upper body showed similar trends, but softer responses than the corresponding data recorded in post mortem human surrogate (PMHS) tests and linearly scaled to average male anthropometry. Finally, the pedestrian model was verified in a Car-to-Pedestrian Collison (CPC) simulation. The marker trajectories recorded in simulation were close to the data recorded on small PMHS in testing and the model predicted typical knee ligament ruptures. Therefore, we believe the F05-PS model, the first FE model developed based on a female reconstructed geometry, could be used to improve vehicle front-end design for pedestrian protection and/or to investigate various pedestrian accidents.},

  abstract = {Pedestrians are one of the most vulnerable road users. In 2019, the USA reported the highest number of pedestrian fatalities number in nearly three decades. To better protect pedestrians in car-to-pedestrian collisions (CPC), pedestrian biomechanics must be better investigated. The pre-impact conditions of CPCs vary significantly in terms of the characteristics of vehicles (e.g., front-end geometry, stiffness, etc.) and pedestrians (e.g., anthropometry, posture, etc.). The influence of pedestrian gait posture has not been well analyzed. The purpose of this study was to numerically investigate the changes in pedestrian kinematics and injuries across various gait postures in two different vehicle impacts. Five finite element (FE) human body models, that represent the 50th percentile male in gait cycle, were developed and used to perform CPC simulations with two generic vehicle FE models representing a low-profile vehicle and a high-profile vehicle. In the impacts with the high-profile vehicle, a sport utility vehicle, the pedestrian models usually slide above the bonnet leading edge and report shorter wrap around distances than in the impacts with a low-profile vehicle, a family car/sedan (FCR). The pedestrian postures influenced the postimpact rotation of the pedestrian and consequently, the impacted head region. Pedestrian posture also influenced the risk of injuries in the lower and upper extremities. Higher bone bending moments were observed in the stance phase posture compared to the swing phase. The findings of this study should be taken into consideration when examining pedestrian protection protocols. In addition, the results of this study can be used to improve the design of active safety systems used to protect pedestrians in collisions.},

However, head anthropometry studies using optical scanning rarely capture scalp shape because of hair interference. Data on scalp shape is available from bald men, but female data are generally not available. To address this issue, scalp shape was digitized in an ethnically diverse sample of 100 adult women, age 18\textendash 59, under a protocol that included whole head surface scanning and scalp measurement using a three-dimensional (3D) coordinate digitizer. A combined male and female sample was created by adding 3D surface scans of a similarly diverse sample of 80 bald men. A statistical head shape model was created by standardizing the head scan data. A total of 58 anatomical head landmarks and 12 head dimensions were obtained from each scan and processed along with the scans. A parametric model accounting for the variability of the head shape under the hair as a function of selected head dimensions was developed. The full-variable model has a mean shape error of 3.8~mm; the 95th percentile error was 7.4~mm, which were measured at the vertices. The model will be particularly useful for generating a series of representing a target population as well as for generating subject-specific head shapes along with predicted landmarks and dimensions. The model is publicly available online at http://humanshape.org/head/.},

Open-Pose, an image-processing toolkit that estimates two-dimensional facial and joint locations from monocular images using a convolutional neural network, was employed to obtain a few facial landmarks from each captured infrared image. A 3D face scan was aligned to reconstructed depth points based on the estimated landmarks and fitted to the points to obtain an accurate 3D head orientation and location of the frame. The newly proposed method significantly improved the robustness of head tracking compared to the previous method. In testing, 93\% of 1330 movement trials between 2 and 5 s in duration were automatically tracked without tracking loss, while the previous method had a success rate of 82\%.},

The ``average shape'' and principal components that were required to cover at least 90\% of the whole variance were identified for both bones, as well as the statistical distributions of the respective principal components weights. Fifteen principal components sufficed to describe the mandibular shape, while nine components sufficed to describe the proximal femur morphology. A routine has been set up to generate any number of mandible or proximal femur geometries, according to the actual statistical shape distributions. The set-up procedure can be generalized to any bone shape given a sufficiently large database of the respective 3D shapes.},

  abstract = {The use of standardized anthropomorphic test devices and test conditions prevent current vehicle development and safety assessments from capturing the breadth of variability inherent in real-world occupant responses. This study introduces a methodology that overcomes these limitations by enabling the assessment of occupant response while accounting for sources of human- and non-human-related variability. Although the methodology is generic in nature, this study explores the methodology in its application to human response in far-side motor vehicle crashes as an example. A total of 405 human body model simulations were conducted in a midsized sedan vehicle environment to iteratively train two neural networks to predict occupant head excursion and thoracic injury as a function of occupant anthropometry, impact direction and restraint configuration. The neural networks were utilized in Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the probability of head-to-intruding-door impacts and thoracic AIS 3\th{} as a function of the restraint configuration. This analysis indicated that the vehicle used in this study would lead to a range of 667 to 2,448 head-to-intruding-door impacts and a range of 3,041 to 3,857 cases of thoracic AIS 3\th{} in the real world, depending on the seatbelt load limiter. These real-world results were later successfully validated using United States field data. This far-side assessment illustrates how the methodology incorporates the human and non-human variability, generates response surfaces that characterize the effects of the variability, and ultimately permits vehicle design considerations and injury predictions appropriate for real-world field conditions.},

A series of tests with three Post-Mortem Human Subjects and the WorldSID was conducted in a vehicle-based sled environment equipped with a far-side airbag. Results of these tests were evaluated and compared to a previous test series conducted without the airbag. All of the PMHS retained the shoulder belt on the shoulder. The airbag significantly reduced PMHS injury severity and maximum lateral head excursion. While the WorldSID exhibited a similar decrease in lateral excursion, it was unable to represent PMHS thoracic deflection or injury probability, and it consistently slipped out of the shoulder belt. This indicates that the WorldSID is limited both in its ability to evaluate the effect of changes in the seatbelt system and in its ability to predict thoracic injury risk and assess airbag-related injury mitigation countermeasures.},

  abstract = {Computational approaches, especially finite element analysis (FEA), have been rapidly growing in both academia and industry during the last few decades. FEA serves as a powerful and efficient approach for simulating real-life experiments, including industrial product development, machine design, and biomedical research, particularly in biomechanics and biomaterials. Accordingly, FEA has been a ``go-to'' high biofidelic software tool to simulate and quantify the biomechanics of the foot\textendash ankle complex, as well as to predict the risk of foot and ankle injuries, which are one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries among physically active individuals. This paper provides a review of the in silico FEA of the foot\textendash ankle complex. First, a brief history of computational modeling methods and finite element (FE) simulations for foot\textendash ankle models is introduced. Second, a general approach to build an FE foot and ankle model is presented, including a detailed procedure to accurately construct, calibrate, verify, and validate an FE model in its appropriate simulation environment. Third, current applications, as well as future improvements of the foot and ankle FE models, especially in the biomedical field, are discussed. Finally, a conclusion is made on the efficiency and development of FEA as a computational approach in investigating the biomechanics of the foot\textendash ankle complex. Overall, this review integrates insightful information for biomedical engineers, medical professionals, and researchers to conduct more accurate research on the foot\textendash ankle FE models in the future.},

  abstract = {Patient specific finite element (FE) modelling of the paediatric spine is an important challenge which offers to revolutionise the treatment of paediatric spinal pathologies, for example adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). In particular, modelling of the intervertebral disc (IVD) is a unique challenge due to its structural and mechanical complexity. This is compounded by limited ability to non-invasively interrogate key mechanical parameters of a patient's IVD. In this work, we seek to better understand the link between mechanical properties and mechanical behaviour of patient specific FE models of the paediatric lumbar spine. A parametric study of IVD parameter was conducted, coupled with insights from current knowledge of the paediatric IVD. In particular, the combined effects of parameters was investigated. Recommendations are made towards areas of importance in patient specific FE modelling of the paediatric IVD. In particular, collagen fibre bundles of the IVD are found to dominate IVD mechanical behaviour and are thus recommended as an area of primary focus for patient specific FE models. In addition, areas requiring further experimental research are identified. This work provides a valuable building block towards the development of patient specific models of the paediatric spine.},

A CORrelation Analysis (CORA) rating was carried out. Based on the CORA score and the proposed biofidelity evaluation procedure the model was considered valid to be used in evaluation of far-side impact countermeasures. The HBM was thereafter positioned in a sled model developed based on the proposed Euro-NCAP 2020 protocol. The predicted risk of rib fractures and lateral head excursion was evaluated both with and without far-side airbag. The proposed far-side airbag was found to reduce head excursion and rib fracture risk in farside impacts from 900 to 150 impact angles.},

  abstract = {To prioritize how the development of mathematical human body models for injury prediction in crash safety analysis should be made, the most frequent injuries in the NASS CDS data from 2000 to 2015 were analyzed. The crashes were divided into seven types, from front to side. Non-minor injuries (AIS2+) were analyzed in two steps. In the first step, a grouping was made according to the AIS definition of body regions: head, face, neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvic contents, spine, upper extremities (including shoulder girdle) and lower extremities (including pelvis). In a second step, the body regions were divided in organs, parts of the spine, and parts of the extremities. The three most often injured anatomical structures of each body region were estimated for drivers and front seat passengers in each type of crash. For drivers, an injury risk greater than 2.4 \% was found for the lower extremities (pelvis) and the head (concussion) in side oblique near side impacts, for the head in frontal oblique near side impacts (concussion) and for the lower extremities (ankle joint) in frontal impacts. For passengers, an injury risk greater than 2.4 \% was found for the thorax (lungs) in side near side impacts, for the head (concussion) in front oblique near side impacts, and for the thorax (sternum) and the upper extremities (wrist, hand) in frontal impacts. Future development of human body models should focus on injuries to the head, thorax and the lower extremities. More specifically, it should focus on concussion in all impact directions and on rib and pelvic fractures in side near side impacts and in side oblique near side impacts.},

  abstract = {Injuries to the hollow organs of the lower digestive system carry substantial risk of complication due to infection and blood loss, and commonly require invasive abdominal surgery to diagnose and treat. The causes of, and risk factors for, lower abdomen injury in automobile collisions are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to investigate the risk factors and potential mechanisms of hollow-organ, lower abdomen injury in belted automobile occupants in frontal collisions. A field survey data analysis was performed to examine the relationship between various occupant and collision factors and the risk of moderate or greater severity injury (i.e., Abbreviated Injury Scale, AIS 2+) to the small intestine, large intestine, or mesentery among belted occupants involved in frontal collisions. Descriptive and comparative risk factor analyses were performed with data originating from that National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS) over the years 2000\textendash 2011. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to describe the effects of these factors on hollow-organ injury risk. Potential injury mechanisms were further investigated through in-depth examination of select cases exhibiting hollow-organ injuries from the Crash Investigation Research and Engineering Network (CIREN). The inclusion criteria yielded 25,407 individual cases from NASS-CDS, representing a weighted population of 11,373,358 exposed automobile occupants. Within this dataset, 143 cases (weighted frequency: 7962 occupants) exhibited AIS 2+ injury to hollow abdominal organs. Multivariable regression analysis indicated a statistically significant increased risk of moderate or greater severity injuries to the hollow organs of the abdomen with increased in {$\Delta$}V (odds ratio (OR) 1.07, 95\% confidence interval: 1.06\textendash 1.09) and age (OR: 1.03, 1.01\textendash 1.06). Albeit non-statistically significant, a positive association between BMI and injury risk was observed, especially among obese individuals (OR: 3.55, 0.82\textendash 15.2). No association was observed for gender or seated location within the vehicle. Result from this study indicate that hollow abdominal organ injury is a universal problem in frontal collisions, not confined to a specific gender or seating location. Examination of CIREN cases suggests these types of injuries are associated with direct loading of the lower abdomen by the lap belt, either through poor initial belt positioning or through a ``submarining'' type of kinematic where the lap belt slips off of the pelvis and loads into the abdomen. Potential countermeasures against hollow-organ abdominal injury should include measures to improve initial lap belt fit, and to retain engagement of the lap belt on the pelvis throughout the collision event.},

  abstract = {The objective of this research is to elucidate the effect of side curtain airbag deployment on occupant injuries and safety when the occupant is either in-position or out-of-position (OOP). We used side impact vehicle collision simulations with a 1996 Dodge Neon model, which was further modified to include a side curtain airbag, a seatbelt, and a 50th percentile Hybrid III dummy. The airbag used in the study was inflated using both the uniform pressure (UP) and smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods. In-position and OOP simulations were performed to assess and establish guidelines for airbag aggressivity thresholds and occupant position versus risk of injury. Three different OOP scenarios (OOP1, OOP2, OOP3) were initially setup following the work of Lund (2003), then modified such that the dummy's head was closer to the airbag, increasing the chance of injury caused by the airbag. The resultant head acceleration as a function of time for in-position and OOP simulations shows that both UP and SPH methods produce similar peak accelerations in cases where the airbag is fully inflated prior to impact. In all cases, the head peak accelerations and the head injury criteria for simulations with an airbag were significantly lower when compared with the no airbag case, which would typically indicate that the use of an airbag results in improved occupant protection during side impact. However, in the case of OOP2 and OOP3, the neck flexion forces actually increase significantly when compared with the no airbag case. This finding indicates that the HIC and neck flexion forces criterion are in conflict and that there may be a tradeoff in terms of occupant injury/safety with a side curtain airbag that is strongly correlated to the occupant position. Consequently, this study shows that safety devices result in a significant effect on occupant injury/safety when the occupant is in OOP conditions. Moreover, in some cases, simulation results show that the side curtain airbag may not make the occupant safer. This study requires further investigation of the vehicle-specific airbag and its interaction with an occupant in various OOP conditions.},

However, it is unclear how relevant the crash configurations in the standard are to present-day motorcycle crashes in Europe, the USA and other parts of the world. We analyzed recent in-depth crash data from Germany, India and China, examining powered two-wheeler (PTW) crash configurations in which at least one police-reported serious injury was present. After assessing the relevance of the ISO's PTW crash configurations to those we found in each country, we suggested new configurations to guide the development of safety systems that would be more effective at reducing PTW-related fatalities and serious injuries. In all three databases, passenger cars were among the top two most frequent collision partners and a car front impacting the side of the PTW was the most common configuration. Notably, although collisions with trucks constituted the most common scenario in India and ground impact (primary collision) was a common scenario in both Germany and India, the ISO did not include either configuration. Further, in three of the seven ISO crash configurations, one of the collision partners is stationary, although stationary collision partners were rare in our data. Our results show that the ISO crash configurations do not represent the most frequent PTW road crashes in Germany, India or China. However, the Chinese database was confined to crashes with a collision partner with four or more wheels. Further, weighting factors for these data were not available, so we could not extrapolate the frequency of the Chinese crash configurations across the entire population. A revised version of the ISO could serve as a basis for a full-scale PTW crash test program. However, the observed differences between countries imply that a single global standard may not be feasible. To optimize the evaluation of a PTW safety system, we recommend the inclusion of configurations which are frequent in the region or country of interest\textemdash in addition to common configurations occurring frequently all around the world.},

In both models, the analyses involve elastic\textendash plastic fracture mechanics for underlying deterministic calculations, statistical representation of uncertainties in loads, crack size, and material properties involving both tensile and fracture toughness characteristics, and standard computational methods of structural reliability theory. Numerical examples are presented for two- and three-dimensional cracked structures. The results show that the probabilistic analysis based on J-estimation model provides accurate estimates of failure probability when compared with those predicted by generally more accurate finite element model. The uncertainty in the crack size, if exists, can have a significant effect on the probability of failure, particularly when the crack size has a large coefficient of variation.

  abstract = {Machine learning has seen a vast increase of interest in recent years, along with an abundance of learning resources. While conventional lectures provide students with important information and knowledge, we also believe that additional project-based learning components can motivate students to engage in topics more deeply. In addition to incorporating project-based learning in our courses, we aim to develop project-based learning components aligned with real-world tasks, including experimental design and execution, report writing, oral presentation, and peer-reviewing. This paper describes the organization of our project-based machine learning courses with a particular emphasis on the class project components and shares our resources with instructors who would like to include similar elements in their courses.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has significantly improved 2D image recognition. Extending into 3D may advance many new applications including autonomous vehicles, virtual and augmented reality, authoring 3D content, and even improving 2D recognition. However despite growing interest, 3D deep learning remains relatively underexplored. We believe that some of this disparity is due to the engineering challenges involved in 3D deep learning, such as efficiently processing heterogeneous data and reframing graphics operations to be differentiable. We address these challenges by introducing PyTorch3D, a library of modular, efficient, and differentiable operators for 3D deep learning. It includes a fast, modular differentiable renderer for meshes and point clouds, enabling analysis-by-synthesis approaches. Compared with other differentiable renderers, PyTorch3D is more modular and efficient, allowing users to more easily extend it while also gracefully scaling to large meshes and images. We compare the PyTorch3D operators and renderer with other implementations and demonstrate significant speed and memory improvements. We also use PyTorch3D to improve the state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D mesh and point cloud prediction from 2D images on ShapeNet. PyTorch3D is open-source and we hope it will help accelerate research in 3D deep learning.},

  abstract = {Objective Self-driving technology will bring novelty in vehicle interior design and allow for a wide variety of occupant seating choices. Previous studies have shown that the increased risk of submarining exhibited by reclined occupants cannot be fully mitigated by changes in the seat configuration alone. This study aims to investigate the effects of three restraint countermeasures on cases with marginal submarining events and estimate their effect on submarining risk and injury prediction metrics.Methods Vehicle environment frontal crash Finite Element (FE) simulations were performed with the two simplified Global Human Body Model Consortium (GHBMC) occupant models: small female and midsize male. The baseline occupant restraints consisted of a frontal airbag, a seatback-integrated 3-point belt with a lap belt anchor pre-tensioner, and a retractor-mounted pre-tensioner and load limiter. Based on submarining thresholds identified in previous studies, three baseline configurations were identified for each occupant size. For each baseline case three restraint system modifications were evaluated. The modifications consisted of the introduction of a pelvis restraint cushion airbag (PRC), the use of a knee airbag (KAB) and the modification of the of the passenger airbag location (PAB). Simulations were performed using the USNCAP 56 km/h frontal crash pulse. Occupant kinematic data was extracted from each simulation to investigate how changes in the restraint system configuration affects submarining.Results Overall, in only one of the investigated cases did the proposed restraint modification prevent submarining occurrence, however each of the restraint modifications reduced the pelvis excursion over the baseline scenario. The presence of the PRC airbag showed the highest reduction in pelvis forward excursion for the female model. The presence of the KAB and the modified location of the PAB also contributed to reductions in excursion to a smaller degree. For the male surrogate, the KAB showed the highest reduction in pelvis forward excursion. The presence of the PRC led to a reduction in the lumbar spine shear force.Conclusions Submarining may be a major challenge to overcome for reclined occupants in autonomous driving systems. This suggests that there may not be a single generalizable currently-existing countermeasure able to effectively prevent marginal submarining cases in reclined positions.},

  abstract = {Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) used in the battlefield cause damage to vehicles and their occupants. The injury burden to the casualties is significant. The biofidelity and practicality of current methods for assessing current protection to reduce the injury severity is limited. In this study, a finite-element (FE) model of the leg was developed and validated in relevant blast-loading conditions, and then used to quantify the level of protection offered by a combat boot. An FE model of the leg of a 35 year old male cadaver was developed. The cadaveric leg was tested physically in a seated posture using a traumatic injury simulator and the results used to calibrate the FE model. The calibrated model predicted hindfoot forces that were in good correlation (using the CORrelation and Analysis or CORA tool) with data from force sensors; the average correlation and analysis rating (according to ISO18571) was 0.842. The boundary conditions of the FE model were then changed to replicate pendulum tests conducted in previous studies which impacted the leg at velocities between 4 to 6.7 m/s. The FE model results of foot compression and peak force at the proximal tibia were within the experimental corridors reported in the studies. A combat boot was then incorporated into the validated computational model. Simulations were run across a range of blast-related loading conditions. The predicted proximal tibia forces and associated risk of injury indicated that the combat boot reduced the injury severity for low severity loading cases with higher times to peak velocity. The reduction in injury risk varied between 6 and 37 \% for calcaneal minor injuries, and 1 and 54 \% for calcaneal major injuries. No injury-risk reduction was found for high severity loading cases. The validated FE model of the leg developed here was able to quantify the protection offered by a combat boot to vehicle occupants across a range of blast-related loading conditions. It can now be used as a design and as an assessment tool to quantify the level of blast protection offered by other mitigation technologies.},

  abstract = {Computational models of the cervical spine are useful tools for research on the biomechanics of neck injury and the evaluation of countermeasures. This report describes the development of a parametric model of cervical spine geometry that is intended to provide input to computational modeling. Two-dimensional landmark data describing the outlines of the bones of the cervical spine and important head landmarks were obtained from lateral radiographs of volunteers in a seated posture taken in a previous study. After imputation and a scaling adjustment, principal component analysis was performed on neutral-posture landmark data from 140 men and women with a wide range of age and body size. The first principal component was primarily related to spine curvature, whereas the second was associated with overall size. A regression analysis predicting principal component scores from subject covariates found significant effects of stature, age, and the ratio of sitting height to stature. Sex was not a significant predictor of principal component scores after accounting for overall body size. A three-dimensional bone shape prediction was created using bone geometry from 38 women extracted from CT studies. A principal component analysis performed on each bone level from C1 to C7 demonstrated that the dominant mode of variation was overall size for C2 but not for the other levels. A detailed examination of vertebra dimensions showed that length, width, and height of the vertebrae and the vertebral bodies at C3 through C7 were not correlated. Two methods for generating 3D geometry to match the 2D predictions were created. First, a method was developed to compute the optimal vector of principal component scores such that the side-view projection of landmarks on the 3D bone best matched the 2D targets. Second, a method based on least- squares alignment and uniform scaling was developed. The method based on principal component scores aligned to the landmarks in the 3D dataset with average root-mean-square (RMS) errors below 1 mm, and matched the mesh with average RMS errors less than 2 mm. When aligning to landmarks generate from the 2D model, RMS errors were less than 2 mm. The RMS errors for the scaling method were only slightly larger. Both the PCAR 2D model and the scaling method for generating 3D bone models were implemented in the Python language for use by other researchers.},

  abstract = {Objective Recent studies have suggested that a relationship exists between crash injury risk and occupant posture, particularly in postures different from those used with anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) in crash testing. The objective of this study was to increase scientific understanding of typical front-seat passenger postures through a naturalistic study. Method Video cameras were installed in the passenger cabins of the vehicles of 75 drivers. Reflective targets were attached to the seats and the seat position and seat back angle was moved through their available ranges during instrumentation. The video data, along with vehicle acceleration and location data, were downloaded after the vehicles were operated as usual by their owners for two weeks. Video frames were manually coded to identify characteristics of front-seat passenger posture and position. Seat position and seat back angle were estimated using the calibration data obtained during vehicle instrumentation. Results Video frames from a total of 2733 trips were coded for 306 unique front-seat passengers. For these trips, a total of 13638 frames were coded; each frame represents about four minutes of travel time. The head was rotated left or right in 33\% of frames, and the torso was rotated left or right about 10\% of the time and pitched forward in almost 10\% of frames. No seat position or seat back angle change was noted in 40 (53\%) of vehicles and the distributions of seat position and seat back angle on arrival were essentially unchanged during travel. The seat was positioned full-rear on the seat track about 23\% of the time and rearward of the mid-track position in 92\% of frames. The mean seat back angle was 25.4 degrees (standard deviation 6.4 degrees); seat back angle was greater than 30 degrees in 15\% of frames and greater than 35 degrees in less than 1\% of frames. Conclusions This study is the first to report distributions of postures, seat positions, and seat back angles for front-seat passengers. Seat positions rearward of the middle of the seat adjustment range are common, but highly reclined postures are infrequent. Non-nominal torso and head postures also are nontrivial.},

Objective To estimate the association of obesity with death risk among drivers of passenger vehicles aged {$\geq$}16 and to examine effect modification by driver sex, driver seat belt use, vehicle type and collision type. Methods We conducted a matched-pair cohort study using data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System. WHO body mass index (BMI) categories were calculated. Data were analysed using conditional Poisson regression. Results Estimated risk ratios (RRs) were slightly raised for underweight drivers (RR=1.19, 95\% CI 0.86 to 1.63). RR increased with higher BMI categories and were 1.21 (0.98 to 1.49) for BMI 30\textendash 34.9, 1.51 (1.10 to 2.08) for BMI 35\textendash 39.9 and 1.80 (1.15 to 2.84) for BMI {$\geq$}40. Estimated BMI effects varied by gender. We found no meaningful variation across levels of vehicle type, collision type or seat belt use. Conclusions Findings from this study suggest that obese vehicle drivers are more likely to die from traffic collision-related injuries than non-obese occupants involved in the same collision. Education is needed to improve seat belt use among obese people, as is research to understand the potential role of comorbidities in injury outcomes.},

  abstract = {Objective Highly automated vehicles may permit alternative seating postures, which could alter occupant kinematics and challenge current restraint designs. One predicted posture is a reclined seated position. While the spine of upright occupants is subjected to flexion during frontal crashes, the orientation of reclined occupants tends to subject the spine to high compressive loads followed by high flexion loads. This study aims to investigate kinematics and mechanisms of loading in the thoracolumbar spine for a reclined seated posture through the use of postmortem human subjects (PMHS).Methods Frontal impact sled tests (50 kph delta-v) were conducted on five adult midsize male PMHS seated with the torso reclined to 50 degrees with respect to the vertical. The PMHS were seated on a semi-rigid seat and restrained by a seat-integrated three-point belt with dual lap-belt pretensioners and a shoulder-belt pretensioner with a 3 kN load-limiter. 3-D kinematic trajectories of five chosen vertebrae, and the pelvis were measured relative to the vehicle buck. Intervertebral pressure transducers were installed at three locations in the lumbar column to detect load timing.Results Three PMHS suffered fractures at L1. Combined compression and flexion of the thoracolumbar spine occurred in all tests, but the magnitude of peak flexion varied across the PMHS. During the PMHS' forward excursion, the pelvis rotated anteriorly in two tests and posteriorly in two tests (lap-belt submarining occurred in one). In one test, the pelvis mount interacted with the seat, but did not affect kinematics.Conclusions Anterior rotation of the pelvis caused increased extension of the lumbar spine, which exacerbated lumbar compression in two of the PMHS; the one subject whose pelvis kinematic tracking was lost exhibited similar compression kinematics. Posterior rotation of the pelvis enabled lumbar flexion, which decreased lumbar compression, but lead to lap-belt submarining in one case. Lumbar kinematics for these reclined frontal impacts were sensitive to changes in initial posture of the spine (magnitude of lordosis or kyphosis) and pelvis (pitch angle). To our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze thoracolumbar kinematics and resulting injuries of a reclined seating posture using PMHS.},

  abstract = {In a population-based, cross-sectional study, we assessed age- and sex-specific changes in bone structure by QCT. Over life, the cross-sectional area of the vertebrae and proximal femur increased by {$\sim$}15\% in both sexes, whereas vBMD at these sites decreased by 39\textendash 55\% and 34\textendash 46\%, respectively, with greater decreases in women than in men. Introduction: The changes in bone structure and density with aging that lead to fragility fractures are still unclear. Materials and Methods: In an age- and sex-stratified population sample of 373 women and 323 men (age, 20\textendash 97 years), we assessed bone geometry and volumetric BMD (vBMD) by QCT at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, distal radius, and distal tibia. Results: In young adulthood, men had 35\textendash 42\% larger bone areas than women (p {$<$} 0.001), consistent with their larger body size. Bone area increased equally over life in both sexes by {$\sim$}15\% (p {$<$} 0.001) at central sites and by {$\sim$}16\% and slightly more in men at peripheral sites. Decreases in trabecular vBMD began before midlife and continued throughout life (p {$<$} 0.001), whereas cortical vBMD decreases began in midlife. Average decreases in trabecular vBMD were greater in women (-55\%) than in men (-46\%, p {$<$} 0.001) at central sites, but were similar (-24\% and -26\%, respectively) at peripheral sites. With aging, cortical area decreased slightly, and the cortex was displaced outwardly by periosteal and endocortical bone remodeling. Cortical vBMD decreased over life more in women ({$\sim$}25\%) than in men ({$\sim$}18\%, p {$<$} 0.001), consistent with menopausal-induced increases in bone turnover and bone porosity. Conclusions: Age-related changes in bone are complex. Some are beneficial to bone strength, such as periosteal apposition with outward cortical displacement. Others are deleterious, such as increased subendocortical resorption, increased cortical porosity, and, especially, large decreases in trabecular vBMD that may be the most important cause of increased skeletal fragility in the elderly. Our findings further suggest that the greater age-related decreases in trabecular and cortical vBMD and perhaps also their smaller bone size may explain, in large part, why fragility fractures are more common in elderly women than in elderly men.},

The materials selected to represent the surrogate cranial tables consisted of two different epoxy resins systems with random milled glass fiber to enhance the strength and stiffness and the materials to represent the surrogate dipl\&\#246;e consisted of three low density foams. Forty-one three-point bending fracture toughness tests were performed on nine material combinations. The materials that best represented the fracture toughness of cranial tables were then selected and formed into tensile samples and tested. These materials were then used with the two surrogate dipl\&\#246;e foam materials to create the three layer surrogate cranial bone samples for three point bending tests. Drop tower tests were performed on flat samples created from these materials and the fracture patterns were very similar to the linear fractures seen in pendulum impacts of intact human skulls. The surrogate cranial tables had the quasi-static fracture toughness and tensile strength of 2.5 MPa{$\surd$}m and 53 \&\#177; 4.9 MPa, respectively, while the same properties of human compact bone were 3.1 \&\#177; 1.8 MPa{$\surd$}m and 68 \&\#177; 18 MPa, respectively. The cranial surrogate had a quasi-static bending strength of 68 \&\#177; 5.7 MPa, while that of cranial bone was 82 \&\#177; 26 MPa. This material/design is currently being used to construct spherical shell samples for drop tower and ballistic tests.},

  abstract = {Global environmental change, in particular climate change, presents a serious threat to the stability of the ecosystems on which all human life depends. On the other hand, mitigating climate change through the decarbonisation of transport, and society more generally, presents unrivalled opportunities for improving public health. The policies that need to be implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will also bring about substantial reductions in heart disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, road deaths and injuries and air pollution. These health benefits arise because climate change policies necessarily impact on two of the most important determinants of health: human movement and human nutrition. Although the health co-benefits of climate change policies are increasingly recognised by health professionals, they are not widely appreciated by those responsible for environmental policy. Because the existence of important health co-benefits will dramatically reduce the cost to society of taking strong action to mitigate climate change, failure to appreciate their importance could have serious environmental consequences. In the transport sector, the creation of safe urban environments for mass active travel will require prioritisation of the needs of pedestrians and cyclists over those of motorists. Walking or cycling should become the most direct, convenient and pleasant option for most urban trips. We have an urgent responsibility to ensure that the health benefits of wider environmental policies are understood by both the public and by policy makers.},

  abstract = {The use of computational modeling to investigate knee joint biomechanics has increased exponentially over the last few decades. Developing computational models is a creative process where decisions have to be made, subject to the modelers' knowledge and previous experiences, resulting in the "art" of modeling. The long-term goal of the KneeHub project is to understand the influence of subjective decisions on the final outcomes and the reproducibility of computational knee joint models. In this paper, we report on the model development phase of this project, investigating model development decisions and deviations from initial modeling plans. Five teams developed computational knee joint models from the same dataset, and we compared each teams' initial uncalibrated models and their model development workflows. Variations in the software tools and modeling approaches were found, resulting in differences such as the representation of the anatomical knee joint structures in the model. The teams defined the boundary conditions in a consistent manner, and used the same anatomical coordinate system convention. However, deviations in the anatomical landmarks used to define the coordinate systems were present, resulting in a large spread in the kinematic outputs of the uncalibrated models. The reported differences and similarities in model development and simulation presented here illustrate the importance of the "art" of modeling and how subjective decision-making can lead to variation in model outputs. All teams deviated from their initial modeling plans, indicating that model development is a flexible process and difficult to plan in advance, even for experienced teams.},

A state-of-the-art validated finite element (FE) head model was used to study the influence of different population human heads on skull fracture for lateral impacts. The mass of the FE head model was altered to match the adult size dummies. Numerical simulations of lateral head impacts for 45 cases (15 experiments\texttimes 3 different population human heads) were performed at velocities ranging from 2.4 to 6.5m/s and three impacting conditions (flat and cylindrical 90D; and flat 40D padding). The entire force-time signals from simulations were compared with experimental mean and upper/lower corridors at each velocity, stiffness (40 and 90 durometer) and shapes (flat and cylindrical) of the impacting surfaces. Average deviation of peak force from the 50th male to 95th male and 5th female were 6.4\% and 10.6\% considering impacts on the three impactors. These results indicate hierarchy of variables which can be used in injury mitigation efforts.},

These data allows analysis of restraint belt geometry and the three-dimensional thoracic deformations generated by belt impingement. One consequence of this new capability is a better understanding of complementary thoracic characterization experiments such as table-top tests and how the thoracic response can be interpreted for applications involving more complex loading mechanisms. This paper reports a detailed evaluation of the timing, magnitude, and direction of the applied belt forces, and the resulting thoracic deformations in two previously performed tests series involving frontal sled tests and table-top belt-loading tests. In the sled tests, the posteriorly directed component (SAE-x) of the belt tension (FB) is FBx = 0.70 FB at the shoulder, but only FBx = 0.14 FB where the belt engages the anterolateral torso inferiorly. The corresponding components on the table top are FBx = 0.60 FB (shoulder) and FBx = 0.48 FB (lower). When these components are cross-plotted with chest deflection, pronounced consequences of thoracic anterior wall deformation patterns due to flexion of the thoracic spine and the internal viscera's inertia can be seen in the effective thoracic stiffness.},

  abstract = {This work introduces the Grassmannian Diffusion Maps, a novel nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that defines the affinity between points through their representation as low-dimensional subspaces corresponding to points on the Grassmann manifold. The method is designed for applications, such as image recognition and data-based classification of high-dimensional data that can be compactly represented in a lower dimensional subspace. The GDMaps is composed of two stages. The first is a pointwise linear dimensionality reduction wherein each high-dimensional object is mapped onto the Grassmann. The second stage is a multi-point nonlinear kernel-based dimension reduction using Diffusion maps to identify the subspace structure of the points on the Grassmann manifold. To this aim, an appropriate Grassmannian kernel is used to construct the transition matrix of a random walk on a graph connecting points on the Grassmann manifold. Spectral analysis of the transition matrix yields low-dimensional Grassmannian diffusion coordinates embedding the data into a low-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Further, a novel data classification/recognition technique is developed based on the construction of an overcomplete dictionary of reduced dimension whose atoms are given by the Grassmannian diffusion coordinates. Three examples are considered. First, a "toy" example shows that the GDMaps can identify an appropriate parametrization of structured points on the unit sphere. The second example demonstrates the ability of the GDMaps to reveal the intrinsic subspace structure of high-dimensional random field data. In the last example, a face recognition problem is solved considering face images subject to varying illumination conditions, changes in face expressions, and occurrence of occlusions.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the whole spine alignment in automotive seated postures for both genders and the effects of the spinal alignment patterns on cervical vertebral motion in rear impact using a human finite element (FE) model.Methods: Image data for 8 female and 7 male subjects in a seated posture acquired by an upright open magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system were utilized. Spinal alignment was determined from the centers of the vertebrae and average spinal alignment patterns for both genders were estimated by multidimensional scaling (MDS). An occupant FE model of female average size (162 cm, 62 kg; the AF 50 size model) was developed by scaling THUMS AF 05. The average spinal alignment pattern for females was implemented in the model, and model validation was made with respect to female volunteer sled test data from rear end impacts. Thereafter, the average spinal alignment pattern for males and representative spinal alignments for all subjects were implemented in the validated female model, and additional FE simulations of the sled test were conducted to investigate effects of spinal alignment patterns on cervical vertebral motion.Results: The estimated average spinal alignment pattern was slight kyphotic, or almost straight cervical and less-kyphotic thoracic spine for the females and lordotic cervical and more pronounced kyphotic thoracic spine for the males. The AF 50 size model with the female average spinal alignment exhibited spine straightening from upper thoracic vertebra level and showed larger intervertebral angular displacements in the cervical spine than the one with the male average spinal alignment.Conclusions: The cervical spine alignment is continuous with the thoracic spine, and a trend of the relationship between cervical spine and thoracic spinal alignment was shown in this study. Simulation results suggested that variations in thoracic spinal alignment had a potential impact on cervical spine motion as well as cervical spinal alignment in rear end impact condition.},

  abstract = {Experimental studies have demonstrated a relationship between spinal injury severity and vertebral kinematics, influenced by the initial spinal alignment of automotive occupants. However, few studies have investigated spinal alignment of automotive occupants in a single posture. To investigate further, this study focused on seat back inclination, which is one of the seat configurations that may affect initial spinal alignment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of seat back inclination on spinal alignments, comparing spinal alignments of automotive seating postures in the 20\textdegree{} and 25\textdegree{} seat back angle, and standing and supine postures. The spinal columns of 11 female and 12 male volunteers in automotive seating postures were scanned in an upright open magnetic response imaging system. Patterns of their spinal alignments were analysed using Multi-Dimensional Scaling presented in a distribution map. Spinal segmental angles were also measured using the imaging data. In the maximum individual variances in spinal alignment, a prominent relationship between the cervical and thoracic spinal alignment was found. Subjects with a more lordotic cervical spine had a pronounced kyphotic thoracic spine, whereas subjects with a straighter to kyphotic cervical spine had a less kyphotic thoracic spine. The gender difference in spinal alignment, for automotive seating postures, were almost straight cervical and less-kyphotic thoracic spine for the female subjects and lordotic cervical and more pronounced kyphotic thoracic spine for the male subjects. The most prominent influence of seatback inclination appeared in thoracic kyphosis, with increased angles for 25\textdegree{} seat back. The difference in thoracic kyphosis between the two seatback angles and between the seating posture with the 20\textdegree{} seat back angle and the standing posture were greater for spinal alignments with a lordotic cervical spine than for spinal alignments with a kyphotic cervical spine.},

Spinal alignments were presented by the geometrical centers of the vertebral bodies extracted from the image data. Cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal alignments were analyzed separately with multidimensional scaling (MDS). Based on distribution maps of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal alignments created by MDS, representative spinal alignment patterns of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spines and the relationship between cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal alignments were investigated. As a result, this study found a correlation between cervical and thoracic spinal alignments in an automotive occupant seated posture. According to representative spinal alignment patterns illustrated by the distribution map of spinal alignments, subjects who had kyphotic cervical spinal alignment tended to have less kyphotic thoracic spinal alignment, while subjects who had lordotic cervical spinal alignment tended to have more kyphotic thoracic spinal alignment. For lumbar spinal alignments, no prominent relationship was found between cervical and thoracic spinal alignment in the seated condition of this study.},

The purpose of this study was to morph an existing finite element (FE) model of the thorax to depict thorax morphology for males and females of ages 30 and 70 years old (YO) and to investigate the effect on injury risk.Methods: Age- and sex-specific FE models were developed using thin-plate spline interpolation. In order to execute the thin-plate spline interpolation, homologous landmarks on the reference, target, and FE model are required. An image segmentation and registration algorithm was used to collect homologous rib and sternum landmark data from males and females aged 0\textendash 100 years. The Generalized Procrustes Analysis was applied to the homologous landmark data to quantify age- and sex-specific isolated shape changes in the thorax. The Global Human Body Models Consortium (GHBMC) 50th percentile male occupant model was morphed to create age- and sex-specific thoracic shape change models (scaled to a 50th percentile male size). To evaluate the thoracic response, 2 loading cases (frontal hub impact and lateral impact) were simulated to assess the importance of geometric and material property changes with age and sex.Results: Due to the geometric and material property changes with age and sex, there were observed differences in the response of the thorax in both the frontal and lateral impacts. Material property changes alone had little to no effect on the maximum thoracic force or the maximum percent compression. With age, the thorax becomes stiffer due to superior rotation of the ribs, which can result in increased bone strain that can increase the risk of fracture. For the 70-YO models, the simulations predicted a higher number of rib fractures in comparison to the 30-YO models. The male models experienced more superior rotation of the ribs in comparison to the female models, which resulted in a higher number of rib fractures for the males.Conclusion: In this study, age- and sex-specific thoracic models were developed and the biomechanical response was studied using frontal and lateral impact simulations. The development of these age- and sex-specific FE models of the thorax will lead to an improved understanding of the complex relationship between thoracic geometry, age, sex, and injury risk.},

  abstract = {Objective: The objective of the study was to develop a disability-based metric for motor vehicle crash (MVC) injuries, with a focus on head injuries, and compare the functional outcomes between the pediatric and adult populations.Methods: Disability risk (DR) was quantified using Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores within the National Trauma Data Bank\textemdash Research Data System (NTDB-RDS) for the top 95\% most frequently occurring Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 3, 4, and 5 head injuries in NASS-CDS 2000\textendash 2011. Pediatric (ages 7\textendash 18), adult (19\textendash 45), middle-aged (46\textendash 65), and older adult (66+) patients with an FIM score available who were alive at discharge and had an AIS 3, 4, or 5 injury were included in the study. The NTDB-RDS contains a truncated form of the FIM instrument, including 3 items (self-feed, locomotion, and verbal expression), each graded on a scale of 1 (full functional dependence) to 4 (full functional independence). Patients within each age group were classified as disabled or not disabled based on the FIM scale. The DR was calculated for each age group by dividing the number of patients who sustained a specific injury and were disabled by the number of patients who sustained the specific injury. To account for the impact of more severe associated coinjuries, a maximum AIS (MAIS) adjusted DR (DRMAIS) was also calculated for each injury. DR and DRMAIS ranged from 0 (0\% disability risk) to 1 (100\% disability risk).Results: An analysis of the most frequent FIM components associated with disabling MVC head injuries revealed that disability across all 3 items (self-feed, locomotion, and expression) was the most frequent for pediatric and adult patients. Only locomotion was the most frequent for middle-aged and older adults. The mean DRMAIS for MVC head injuries was 35\% for pediatric patients, 36\% for adults, 38\% for middle-aged adults, and 44\% for older adults. Further analysis was conducted by grouping the head injuries into 8 groups based on the structure of injury and injury type. The pediatric population possessed higher DRMAIS values for brain stem injuries as well as loss of consciousness injuries. Older adults possessed higher DRMAIS values for contusion/hemorrhage injuries, epidural hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, skull fracture, and subdural/subarachnoid hemorrhage.Conclusion: At-risk populations such as pediatric and older adult patients possessed higher DRMAIS values for different head injuries. Disability in pediatric patients is critical due to loss of quality life years. Disability risk can supplement severity metrics to improve the ability of such metrics to discriminate the severity of different injuries that do not lead to death. Understanding of age-related differences in injury outcomes when compared to adults could inform future age-specific modifications to the AIS.},

  abstract = {Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), and the underlying brain networks identified with it, have recently appeared as a promising avenue for the evaluation of functional deficits without the need for active patient participation. We hypothesise here that such alteration can be inferred from tissue damage within the network. From an engineering perspective, the numerical prediction of tissue mechanical damage following an impact remains computationally expensive. To this end, we propose a numerical framework aimed at predicting resting state network disruption for an arbitrary head impact, as described by the head velocity, location and angle of impact, and impactor shape. The proposed method uses a library of precalculated cases leveraged by a machine learning layer for efficient and quick prediction. The accuracy of the machine learning layer is illustrated with a dummy fall case, where the machine learning prediction is shown to closely match the full simulation results. The resulting framework is finally tested against the rsfMRI data of nine TBI patients scanned within 24 hours of injury, for which paramedical information was used to reconstruct in silico the accident. While more clinical data are required for full validation, this approach opens the door to i) on-the-fly prediction of rsfMRI alterations, readily measurable on clinical premises from paramedical data, and ii) reverse-engineered accident reconstruction through rsfMRI measurements.},

  abstract = {Introduction: A simplified and computationally efficient human body finite element model is presented. The model complements the Global Human Body Models Consortium (GHBMC) detailed 50th percentile occupant (M50-O) by providing kinematic and kinetic data with a significantly reduced run time using the same body habitus.Methods: The simplified occupant model (M50-OS) was developed using the same source geometry as the M50-O. Though some meshed components were preserved, the total element count was reduced by remeshing, homogenizing, or in some cases omitting structures that are explicitly contained in the M50-O. Bones are included as rigid bodies, with the exception of the ribs, which are deformable but were remeshed to a coarser element density than the M50-O. Material models for all deformable components were drawn from the biomechanics literature. Kinematic joints were implemented at major articulations (shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle) with moment vs. angle relationships from the literature included for the knee and ankle. The brain of the detailed model was inserted within the skull of the simplified model, and kinematics and strain patterns are compared.Results: The M50-OS model has 11 contacts and 354,000 elements; in contrast, the M50-O model has 447 contacts and 2.2 million elements. The model can be repositioned without requiring simulation. Thirteen validation and robustness simulations were completed. This included denuded rib compression at 7 discrete sites, 5 rigid body impacts, and one sled simulation. Denuded tests showed a good match to the experimental data of force vs. deflection slopes. The frontal rigid chest impact simulation produced a peak force and deflection within the corridor of 4.63 kN and 31.2\%, respectively. Similar results vs. experimental data (peak forces of 5.19 and 8.71 kN) were found for an abdominal bar impact and lateral sled test, respectively. A lateral plate impact at 12 m/s exhibited a peak of roughly 20 kN (due to stiff foam used around the shoulder) but a more biofidelic response immediately afterward, plateauing at 9 kN at 12 ms. Results from a frontal sled simulation showed that reaction forces and kinematic trends matched experimental results well. The robustness test demonstrated that peak femur loads were nearly identical to the M50-O model. Use of the detailed model brain within the simplified model demonstrated a paradigm for using the M50-OS to leverage aspects of the M50-O. Strain patterns for the 2 models showed consistent patterns but greater strains in the detailed model, with deviations thought to be the result of slightly different kinematics between models. The M50-OS with the deformable skull and brain exhibited a run time 4.75 faster than the M50-O on the same hardware.Conclusions: The simplified GHBMC model is intended to complement rather than replace the detailed M50-O model. It exhibited, on average, a 35-fold reduction in run time for a set of rigid impacts. The model can be used in a modular fashion with the M50-O and more broadly can be used as a platform for parametric studies or studies focused on specific body regions.},

Evidence documenting the existence of selective reporting and excessive duplication of reviews on the same or similar topics is accumulating and many calls have been made in support of the documentation and public availability of review protocols. Several efforts have emerged in recent years to rectify these problems, including development of an international register for prospective reviews (PROSPERO) and launch of the first open access journal dedicated to the exclusive publication of systematic review products, including protocols (BioMed Central's Systematic Reviews). Furthering these efforts and building on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, an international group of experts has created a guideline to improve the transparency, accuracy, completeness, and frequency of documented systematic review and meta-analysis protocols\textemdash PRISMA-P (for protocols) 2015. The PRISMA-P checklist contains 17 items considered to be essential and minimum components of a systematic review or meta-analysis protocol. This PRISMA-P 2015 Explanation and Elaboration paper provides readers with a full understanding of and evidence about the necessity of each item as well as a model example from an existing published protocol. This paper should be read together with the PRISMA-P 2015 statement. Systematic review authors and assessors are strongly encouraged to make use of PRISMA-P when drafting and appraising review protocols.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The 2 objectives of this study are to (1) examine the rib and sternal fractures sustained by small stature elderly females in simulated frontal crashes and (2) determine how the findings are characterized by prior knowledge and field data.Methods: A test series was conducted to evaluate the response of 5 elderly (average age 76 years) female postmortem human subjects (PMHS), similar in mass and size to a 5th percentile female, in 30 km/h frontal sled tests. The subjects were restrained on a rigid planar seat by bilateral rigid knee bolsters, pelvic blocks, and a custom force-limited 3-point shoulder and lap belt. Posttest subject injury assessment included identifying rib cage fractures by means of a radiologist read of a posttest computed tomography (CT) and an autopsy. The data from a motion capture camera system were processed to provide chest deflection, defined as the movement of the sternum relative to the spine at the level of T8. A complementary field data investigation involved querying the NASS-CDS database over the years 1997\textendash 2012. The targeted cases involved belted front seat small female passenger vehicle occupants over 40 years old who were injured in 25 to 35 km/h delta-V frontal crashes (11 to 1 o'clock).Results: Peak upper shoulder belt tension averaged 1,970 N (SD = 140 N) in the sled tests. For all subjects, the peak x-axis deflection was recorded at the sternum with an average of -44.5 mm or 25\% of chest depth. The thoracic injury severity based on the number and distribution of rib fractures yielded 4 subjects coded as Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 3 (serious) and one as AIS 5 (critical). The NASS-CDS field data investigation of small females identified 205 occupants who met the search criteria. Rib fractures were reported for 2.7\% of the female occupants.Conclusions: The small elderly test subjects sustained a higher number of rib cage fractures than expected in what was intended to be a minimally injurious frontal crash test condition. Neither field studies nor prior laboratory frontal sled tests conducted with 50th percentile male PMHS predicted the injury severity observed. Although this was a limited study, the results justify further exploration of the risk of rib cage injury for small elderly female occupants.},

We hypothesized that measurements made from radiographs of cadaveric proximal humeri are stronger predictors of fracture strength than chronological age or bone density values derived from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Thirty-three proximal humeri (range: 39-78 years) were analyzed for: (1) bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm(2)) using DXA, (2) bulk density (g/cm(3)) using DXA and volume displacement, (3) regional bone density in millimeters of aluminum (mmAl) using radiographs, and (4) regional mean (medial+lateral) cortical thickness and cortical index (CI) using radiographs. The bones were then fractured simulating a fall. Strongest correlations with ultimate fracture load (UFL) were: mean cortical thickness at two diaphyseal locations (r\,=\,0.71; p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and mean mmAl in the humeral head (r\,=\,0.70; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Weaker correlations were found between UFL and DXA-BMD (r\,=\,0.60), bulk density (r\,=\,0.43), CI (r\,=\,0.61), and age (r\,=\,-0.65) (p values {$<$}0.01). Analyses between UFL and the product of any two characteristics showed six combinations with r-values {$>$}0.80, but none included DXA-derived density, CI, or age. Radiographic morphometric and densitometric measurements from radiographs are therefore stronger predictors of UFL than age, CI, or DXA-derived density measurements.},

  abstract = {Osteoporosis is a systemic disorder predominantly affecting postmenopausal women but also men at an advanced age. Both genders may suffer from low-energy fractures of, for example, the proximal humerus when reduction of the bone stock or/and quality has occurred.The aim of the current study was to compare the amount of bone in typical fracture zones of the proximal humerus in osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic individuals.The amount of bone in the proximal humerus was determined histomorphometrically in frontal plane sections. The donor bones were allocated to normal and osteoporotic groups using the T-score from distal radius DXA measurements of the same extremities. The T-score evaluation was done according to WHO criteria. Regional thickness of the subchondral plate and the metaphyseal cortical bone were measured using interactive image analysis.At all measured locations the amount of cancellous bone was significantly lower in individuals from the osteoporotic group compared to the non-osteoporotic one. The osteoporotic group showed more significant differences between regions of the same bone than the non-osteoporotic group. In both groups the subchondral cancellous bone and the subchondral plate were least affected by bone loss. In contrast, the medial metaphyseal region in the osteoporotic group exhibited higher bone loss in comparison to the lateral side.This observation may explain prevailing fracture patterns, which frequently involve compression fractures and certainly has an influence on the stability of implants placed in this medial region. It should be considered when planning the anchoring of osteosynthesis materials in osteoporotic patients with fractures of the proximal humerus.},

  abstract = {Objective Improvements in road infrastructure and vehicle safety have been achieved in many countries during the last decades. As the number of fatalities have dropped, the consequences of non-fatal injuries have been brought into focus. Therefore, the objective was to investigate self-reported health status and health-related quality of life several years after the crash for road-users that sustained injuries resulting in permanent medical impairment (PMI). Methods A self-administered questionnaire using instruments to measure if health, health-related quality of life and physical activity had been affected by the crash, were used. The injured road-users were identified from insurance policy holders of the Folksam Insurance Group. The response rate was 29\%, a total of 2078 responses were received from the 7174 road-users with PMI that received the questionnaire. Results In total 85\% were still suffering from the injuries several years after the crash (8-18 year after the crash). Furthermore, road-users with injuries to the spine were having highest pain intensity. Older road-users had poorer self-reported health status than younger road-users. Although, younger road-users had the greatest change in physical activity when comparing before and after the crash. Before the crash in total 63\% were physically active while only 34\% after the crash. The higher the PMI the higher it affected health several years after the crash. Conclusions The Swedish definition of serious injury, an injury leading to PMI, was found to correlate with self-reported health loss; 85\% of the injured road-users reported that they still had remaining symptoms several years after the accident. The injured body region leading to PMI after an accident can vary from the body regions reported to cause long-term health loss. It was found that the higher the degree of PMI the higher the health loss. Sustaining a PMI regardless severity and injured body region has the same effects on general health for men and women. Sustaining a PMI will both lower the health-related quality of life and physical activity after the crash compared to before.},

This study investigates current injury patterns at the MAIS 3+ level in the accident environment without limiting the impact direction. The approach consisted of applying unsupervised clustering algorithms to NASS-CDS crash data in order to classify seriously injured, belted occupants into clusters based on injured body regions, biomechanical characteristics and crash severity. Injury patterns in each cluster were analyzed and associated with other characteristics of the crash, such as the collision configuration. The groups of seriously injured occupants found in this research contain a large amount of information and research possibilities. The resulting clusters represent new opportunities for vehicle safety, which have been highlighted in this study.},

  abstract = {The mechanical behavior of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) affects the interaction between vehicle occupants and restraint systems in motor vehicle crashes (MVCs). To enhance future restraints, injury countermeasures, and other vehicle safety systems, computational simulations are often used to augment experiments because of their relative efficiency for parametric analysis. How well finite element human body models (FE-HBMs), which are often used in such simulations, predict human response has been limited by the absence of material models for human SAT that are applicable to the MVC environment. In this study, for the first time, dynamic multidirectional unconfined compression and simple shear loading tests were performed on human abdominal SAT specimens under conditions similar to MVCs. We also performed multiple ramp-hold tests to evaluate the quasilinear viscoelasticity (QLV) assumption and capture the stress relaxation behavior under both compression and shear. Our mechanical characterization was supplemented with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) performed in different orientations to investigate whether the macrostructural response can be related to the underlying microstructure. While the overall structure was shown to be visually different in different anatomical planes, a preferred orientation of any fibrous structures could not be identified. We showed that the nonlinear, viscoelastic, and direction-dependent responses under compression and shear tests could be captured by incorporating QLV in an Ogden-type hyperelastic model. Our comprehensive approach will lead to more accurate computational simulations and support the collective effort on the research of future occupant protection systems. Statement of Significance : There is an urgent need to characterize the mechanical behavior of human adipose tissue under multiple dynamic loading conditions, and to identify constitutive models that are able to capture the tissue response under these conditions. We performed the first series of experiments on human adipose tissue specimens to characterize the multi-directional compression and shear behavior at impact loading rates and obtained scanning electron microscope images to investigate whether the macrostructural response can be related to the underlying microstructure. The results showed that human adipose tissue is nonlinear, viscoelastic and direction dependent, and its mechanical response under compression and shear tests at different loading rates can be captured by incorporating quasi-linear viscoelasticity in an Ogden-type hyperelastic model.},

  abstract = {impact-velocities (\&lt;20 km/h) often cause pain in the  neck region as well as a number of other neurological  symptoms, most of which can be related to the nerve  paths that pass through the cervical intervertebral  foramina.  When the neck is flexed or extended in the sagittal  plane the length of the cervical spinal canal alters but  the cross-sectional area of the canal remains almost  constant. During flexion-extension motion of the  cervical spine, the size of the inner volume of the  spinal canal will change. Since the tissues inside the  canal can be considered incompressible, an alteration  will take place of either the amount of cerebro spinal  fluid or the amount of blood in the veinplexa of the  epidural space, or both. This requires fluid  transportation through the intervertebral foramina as  well as along the spinal canal. During a whiplash  extension motion, the flow velocity can be expected to  rise far above physiologically normal levels and  pressure gradients can thus be expected to occur. In turn,  the soft tissues inside and around the cervical spine and  particularly in the intervertebral foramina will sustain  mechanical strain and stress.  Anaesthetised pigs were exposed to a swift  extension-flexion motion of the neck while the  pressure inside the spinal canal and the skull was  measured. Pressure pulses of magnitudes up to 150  mmHg (20 kPa) were observed during the motion. The  magnitude of pressure is for each moment dependent on  the position of the neck, the velocity and the  acceleration of the motion.  Plasma membrane dysfunction was indicated by the  results from light microscopic analyses of the cervical  and the three upper thoracic spinal ganglia revealing  the staining of nerve cells and satellite cells by protein  complexed to the Evans Blue dye.},

  abstract = {Objective: Fatal brain injuries result from physiological changes in brain tissues, subsequent to primary damage caused by head impact. Although efforts have been made in past studies to estimate the probability of brain injury, none of them involved prediction of such physiological changes. The goal of this study was to evaluate the fatality prediction capability of a novel approach that predicts an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) due to primary head injury to estimate the fatality rate using clinical data that correlate ICP with fatality rate.Methods: A total of 12 sets of head acceleration time histories were used to represent no, severe, and fatal brain injury. They were obtained from the literature presenting head kinematics data in noninjurious volunteer sled tests or from accident reconstruction for severe and fatal injury cases. These were first applied to a Global Human Body Models Consortium (GHBMC) head\textendash brain model to predict nodal displacement time histories of the brain, which were then fed into FEBio to predict ICP. A Weibull distribution was applied to the data for the relationship between fatality rate and ICP obtained from a clinical paper to estimate fatality rate from ICP (procedure A). Fatality rate was also estimated by applying the temporal and spatial maximum value of maximum principal strain (MPSmax) obtained from the GHBMC simulation to an injury probability function for MPSmax (procedure B). Estimated fatality rates were compared between the 2 procedures.Results: Both procedures estimated higher average fatality rate for higher injury severity. The average fatality rate for procedure A without ischemia representation and procedure B was 72.4 and 51.0\% for the fatal injury group and 8.2 and 21.7\% for the severe injury group, respectively, showing that procedure A provides more distinct classification between fatal and nonfatal brain injury. It was also found that representation of ischemia in procedure A provides results sensitive to injury severity and impact conditions, requiring further validation of the initial estimate for the relationship between brain compression and ischemic cell death.Conclusions: Prediction of the probability of fatality by means of a combination of simulations of the primary brain deformation and subsequent ICP increase was found to be more distinct compared to the prediction of primary injury alone combined with the injury probability function from a past study in the select 12 head impact cases.},

Deforming 3D meshes are flexible to represent 3D animation sequences as well as collections of objects of the same category, allowing diverse shapes with large-scale non-linear deformations. We propose a novel framework which we call mesh variational autoencoders (mesh VAE), to explore the probabilistic latent space of 3D surfaces. The framework is easy to train, and requires very few training examples. We also propose an extended model which allows flexibly adjusting the significance of different latent variables by altering the prior distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our general framework is able to learn a reasonable representation for a collection of deformable shapes, and produce competitive results for a variety of applications, including shape generation, shape interpolation, shape space embedding and shape exploration, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.},

A disproportionately high burden of road traffic deaths and injuries occur in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) (90\%), and the burden is expected to increase due to rapid urbanisation and motorisation in LMICs. This chapter presents a summary of the past efforts aimed at reducing the burden of RTIs in LMICs and highlights the need for the production of new knowledge instead of relying on road design standards which have been developed in high-income countries (HICs). There are two important concerns in using or developing highway design standards mainly based on those in use in USA or UK. The traffic mix for which these standards have been developed is very different from the traffic existing in LMICs. The second concern is whether the design standards are based on traffic safety science even in the HICs. Given the complexity of traffic safety science and its implementation in the field, continuous experimentation is required in the LMICs to develop safe highways based on the principles of a safe systems approach.},

Methods A scoping review of literature published from 2010 to 2020 was undertaken following accepted guidelines. Relevant articles were identified in Medline, Embase, SafetyLit and Transport Research International Documentation using terms related to electric scooters, injuries and incident circumstances. Supplemental searches were conducted to identify relevant grey literature (non-peer-reviewed reports). Results Twenty-eight peer-reviewed studies and nine grey literature records were included in the review. The current literature surrounding electric scooter-associated injuries mainly comprises retrospective case series reporting clinical variables. Factors relating to injury circumstances are inconsistently reported. Findings suggest that the head, upper extremities and lower extremities are particularly vulnerable in electric scooter falls or collisions, while injuries to the chest and abdomen are less common. Injury severity was inconsistently reported, but most reported injuries were minor. Low rates of helmet use among electric scooter users were noted in several studies. Conclusion Electric scooters leave riders vulnerable to traumatic injuries of varying severity. Future work should prospectively collect standardised data that include information on the context of the injury event and key clinical variables. Research on interventions to prevent electric scooter injuries is also needed to address this growing area of concern.},

  abstract = {Between 2005 and 2011, the number of traffic fatalities in the U.S. declined by 11,031, from 43,510 in 2005 to 32,479 in 2011. This decline amounted to a reduction in traffic-related deaths of 25.4 percent, by far the greatest decline over a comparable period in the last 30 years.Historically, significant drops in traffic fatalities over a short period of time have coincided with economic recessions. Longer recessions have coincided with deeper declines in the number of traffic fatalities. This TRB National Cooperative Highway Research Program's NCHRP Research Report 928: Identification of Factors Contributing to the Decline of Traffic Fatalities in the United States from 2008 to 2012 provides an analysis that identifies the specific factors in the economic decline that affected fatal crash risk, while taking into account the long-term factors that determine the level of traffic safety.A key insight into the analysis of the factors that produced the sharp drop in traffic fatalities was that the young contributed disproportionately to the drop-off in traffic fatalities. Of the reduction in traffic fatalities from 2007 to 2011, people 25-years-old and younger accounted for nearly 48 percent of the drop, though they were only about 28 percent of total traffic fatalities prior to the decline. Traffic deaths among people 25-years-old and younger dropped substantially more than other groups. Young drivers are known to be a high-risk group and can be readily identified in the crash data. Other high-risk groups also likely contributed to the decline but they cannot be identified as well as age can.},

  abstract = {Physical phenomena in nature are typically represented by complex systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or partial differential equations (PDEs), modeling a wide range of spatio-temporal scales and multi-physics. The field of computational science has achieved indisputable success in advancing our understanding of the natural world - made possible through a combination of increasingly sophisticated mathematical models, numerical techniques and hardware resources. Furthermore, there has been a recent revolution in the data-driven sciences - spurred on by advances in the deep learning/stochastic optimization communities and the democratization of machine learning (ML) software.{$<$}br{$>$}With the ubiquity of use of computational models for analysis and prediction of physical systems, there has arisen a need for rigorously characterizing the effects of unknown variables in a system. Unfortunately, Uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks such as model calibration, uncertainty propagation, and optimization under uncertainty, typically require several thousand evaluations of the underlying physical models. In order to deal with the high cost of the forward model, one typically resorts to the surrogate idea - replacing the true response surface with an approximation that is both accurate as well cheap (computationally speaking). However, state-ofart numerical systems are often characterized by a very large number of stochastic parameters - of the order of hundreds or thousands. The high cost of individual evaluations of the forward model, coupled with the limited real world computational budget one is constrained to work with, means that one is faced with the task of constructing a surrogate model for a system with high input dimensionality and small dataset sizes. In other words, one faces the \emph{curse of dimensionality}.{$<$}br{$>$}In this dissertation, we propose multiple ways of overcoming the\emph{ curse of dimensionality} when constructing surrogate models for high-dimensional numerical simulators. The core idea binding all of our proposed approach is simple - we try to discover special structure in the stochastic parameter which captures most of the variance of the output quantity of interest. Our strategies first identify such a low-rank structure, project the high-dimensional input onto it, and then link the projection to the output. If the dimensionality of the low dimensional structure is small enough, learning the map between this reduced input space to the output is a much easier task incomparison to the original surrogate modeling task.},

  abstract = {Vehicle safety systems have substantially decreased motor vehicle crash-related injuries and fatalities, but injuries to the lumbar spine still have been reported. Experimental and computational analyses of upright and, particularly, reclined occupants in frontal crashes have shown that the lumbar spine can be subjected to simultaneous and out-of-phase combined axial compression and flexion loading. Lumbar spine failure tolerance in combined compression-flexion has not been widely explored in the literature. Therefore, the goal of this study was to measure the failure tolerance of the lumbar spine in combined compression and flexion. Forty lumbar spine segments with three vertebrae (one unconstrained) and two intervertebral discs (both unconstrained) were pre-loaded with axial compression (2200N, 3300N, or 4500N) and then subjected to rotation-controlled dynamic flexion bending until failure. Clinically relevant middle vertebra fractures were observed in twenty-one of the specimens, including compression and burst fractures. The remaining nineteen specimens experienced failure at the potting-grip interface. Failure tolerance varied within the sample and were categorized by the appropriate data censoring, with clinically relevant middle vertebrae fractures characterized as uncensored or left-censored and potting-grip fractures characterized as right-censored. Average failure force and moment were 3290N (range: 1580N to 5042N) and 51Nm (range: 0Nm to 156 Nm) for uncensored data, 3686N (range: 3145N to 4112N) and 0Nm for left-censored data, and 3470N (range: 2138N to 5062N) and 101Nm (range: 27Nm to 182Nm) for right-censored data. These data can be used to develop and improve injury prediction tools for lumbar spine fractures and further research in future safety systems.},

  abstract = {Objective The integrity of the scalp overlying a cochlear implant receiver stimulator (RS) is critical for the long-term survival of the implant. Exposure or extrusion of the device will likely result in the need for its removal. There is a global trend of acceleration of population aging, thus raising the prevalence of cochlear implantation (CI) in the elderly. The aim of this study was to define age-dependent changes in scalp thickness and discuss the implication of that anatomical characteristic for CI in the geriatric population. Methods Scalp thickness over the location of the RS in the temporo-parietal area was measured directly with a needle in patients of various ages. Results Two-hundred thirty-six temporo-parietal scalps were measured in patients aged 18 to 85 years. A strong inverse correlation was found between age and scalp thickness (rs = -0.723, P {$<$} .001). Scalp thickness decreased with age from a mean of 8 mm in the third decade of life to 5 mm in the ninth decade of life. Conclusion The human scalp thins with age and most likely undergoes a reduction in its strength. As a consequence, implantable hearing devices that are shielded by the scalp can be at increased risk of exposure and extrusion in the aging recipient. This needs to be taken into account when considering an implantation procedure, the surgical approach and patient instructions on need for and venues for continuing care over time.

  abstract = {Uncertainty is an inherent part of knowledge, and yet in an era of contested expertise, many shy away from openly communicating their uncertainty about what they know, fearful of their audience's reaction. But what effect does communication of such epistemic uncertainty have? Empirical research is widely scattered across many disciplines. This interdisciplinary review structures and summarizes current practice and research across domains, combining a statistical and psychological perspective. This informs a framework for uncertainty communication in which we identify three objects of uncertainty\textemdash facts, numbers and science\textemdash and two levels of uncertainty: direct and indirect. An examination of current practices provides a scale of nine expressions of direct uncertainty. We discuss attempts to codify indirect uncertainty in terms of quality of the underlying evidence. We review the limited literature about the effects of communicating epistemic uncertainty on cognition, affect, trust and decision-making. While there is some evidence that communicating epistemic uncertainty does not necessarily affect audiences negatively, impact can vary between individuals and communication formats. Case studies in economic statistics and climate change illustrate our framework in action. We conclude with advice to guide both communicators and future researchers in this important but so far rather neglected field.},

Objective.~         The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of changes in muscle morphology in patients with chronic idiopathic neck pain (CINP) and chronic whiplash-associated disorder (CWAD).         Summary of Background Data.~         Worldwide, neck pain (NP) is a common health problem with high socioeconomic burden. A high percentage of these patients evolves toward chronic symptoms. Efficacy of treatments for these complaints remains variable. In current literature, changes in muscle morphology (muscle fat infiltration and cross-sectional area) have been reported in patients with NP, both CWAD and CINP. However, no strong conclusions could be made.         Methods.~         In this study, magnetic resonance imaging was used to obtain data on muscle morphology from 14 cervical flexor and extensor muscles in 117 female subjects with NP (CWAD = 37; CINP = 45) and healthy controls (HC = 35).         Results.~         The CWAD group had a significantly larger muscle fat infiltration in some extensor (semispinalis and splenius capitis, trapezius, obliquus capitis inferior) and flexor (sternocleidomastoid) muscles compared to the CINP and/or HC group. A significantly larger (muscle) cross-sectional area was found in some extensor (levator scapulae, semispinalis capitis, trapezius) and flexor (longus colli, longus capitis, sternocleidomastoid) muscles in the HC group compared to the CINP and/or CWAD group. No clear associations were found between group differences and factors as pain duration, kinesiophobia, and disability.         Conclusion.~         The results in this study suggest changes in muscle morphology in both NP cohorts. These results show some similarities with earlier findings in this research domain. Further studies based on controlled longitudinal designs are needed to facilitate data compilation, to draw stronger conclusions, and to integrate them into the treatment of patients with chronic NP.

  abstract = {Abstract, A multi-body computational model of the human head and neck was previously shown to be in good agreement with experimental findings from actual human cervical spine specimens. The model segments were tested in three directions of loading showing main and coupled motions to be accurate and realistic., The model's ability to predict the dynamic response of the head and neck, when subjected to acceleration pulses representing frontal, lateral, and rear-end impacts, is verified using experimental data derived from sled acceleration tests with human volunteers for 15 g frontal and 7 g lateral impacts and from isolated cervical spine specimen tests for rear-end impacts. Response corridors based on sled acceleration tests with human volunteers for frontal and lateral impacts are used to evaluate the model and investigate the effect of muscle activation on the head-neck motion. Firstly, the impacts are simulated with both passive and active muscle behaviour. Secondly, the local loads in the soft-tissue elements during the frontal impact are analysed. For rear-end impact simulation experiments using ligamentous isolated cervical spine specimens are used to evaluate the model performance before investigating the effects of muscle tensioning., Good agreement with human volunteer response corridors resulting from frontal and lateral impacts, and isolated cervical spine specimen sled test rear-end impact experiments is demonstrated for the model, highlighting the important role the muscles of the neck play in the head-neck response to acceleration impacts. The model is shown to be able to predict the loads and deformations of the cervical spine components making it suitable for injury analysis.},

Force and deflection outputs from the model were compared to experimental traces and corridors scaled to the 50th percentile male. Predicted fractures and injury severity measures were compared to evaluate the model's injury prediction capabilities. The methods of ISO/TS 18571 were used to quantitatively assess the fit of model outputs to experimental force and deflection traces. The model produced peak chest, shoulder, thoracoabdominal, abdominal, and pelvis forces of 4.8, 3.3, 4.5, 5.1, and 13.0~kN compared to 4.3, 3.2, 4.0, 4.0, and 10.3~kN in the experiments, respectively. The model predicted rib and pelvic fractures related to Abbreviated Injury Scale scores within the ranges found experimentally all cases except the abdominal impact. ISO/TS 18571 scores for the impacts studied had a mean score of 0.73 with a range of 0.57\textendash 0.83. Well-validated FEMs are important tools used by engineers in advancing occupant safety.},

  abstract = {Skull fracture is a frequently observed type of severe head injury. Historically, a variety of impact test set-ups and techniques have been used for investigating skull fracture. The most frequently used are the free-fall technique, the guided fall or drop tower set-up and the piston-driven impactor set-up. This document proposes a new type of set-up for cadaver head impact testing which combines the strengths of the most frequently used techniques and devices. The set-up consists of two pendulums, which allow for a 1 degree of freedom rotational motion. The first pendulum is the impactor and is used to strike the blow. The head is attached to the second pendulum using a polyester resin. Local skull deformation and impact force are measured with a sample frequency of 65kHz. From these data, absorbed energy until skull fracture is calculated. A set-up evaluation consisting of 14 frontal skull and head impact tests shows an accurate measurement of both force and local skull deformation until fracture of the skull. Simplified mechanical models are used to analyse the different impacting techniques from literature as well as the new proposed set-up. It is concluded that the proposed test set-up is able to accurately calculate the energy absorbed by the skull until fracture with an uncertainty interval of 10\%. Second, it is concluded that skull fracture caused by blunt impact occurs before any significant motion of the head. The two-pendulum set-up is the first head impact device to allow a well-controlled measurement environment without altering the skull stress distribution.},

Chest and abdominal injuries consisted primarily of rib fractures, with a few cases of lung or liver laceration in the highest severity impacts. There were two cases of pubic ramus fracture in the pelvic impacts. Logist analysis of the biomechanical responses and injury indicated that the maximum Viscous response had a slightly better correlation with injury than maximum compression for chest and abdominal impacts. A tolerance level of VC = 1.47 m/s for the chest and VC = 1.98 m/s for the abdomen were determined for a 25\% probability of critical injury. Maximum compression was similarly set at C = 38\% for the chest and at C = 44\% for the abdomen. The experiments indicate that chest and abdominal injury may occur by a viscous mechanism during the rapid phase of body compression, and that the Viscous and compression responses are effective, complementary measures of injury risk in side impact. Although serious pelvic injury was infrequent, lateral public ramus fracture correlated with compression of the pelvis, not impact force or pelvic acceleration. Pelvic tolerance was set at 27\% compression.},

These practices have been empirically demonstrated to enhance student learning and attitudes. However, research indicates that instructors often adapt rather than adopt practices, unknowingly compromising their effectiveness. Thus, there is a need to raise awareness of the research-based implementation of these practices, develop fidelity of implementation protocols to understand adaptations being made, and ultimately characterize the true impact of reform efforts based on these practices. Peer instruction (PI) is an example of an evidence-based instructional practice that consists of asking students conceptual questions during class time and collecting their answers via clickers or response cards. Extensive research has been conducted by physics and biology education researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of this practice and to better understand the intricacies of its implementation. PI has also been investigated in other disciplines, such as chemistry and computer science. This article reviews and summarizes these various bodies of research and provides instructors and researchers with a research-based model for the effective implementation of PI. Limitations of current studies and recommendations for future empirical inquiries are also provided.},

Existing neck injury criteria are based on experimental studies that included sled tests performed with volunteers, post-mortem human surrogates and animals.

Thus, this work analyzed the estimated axial and shear forces, and the bending moment at the craniocervical junction of nine young volunteers (18-30 years old) and four elderly volunteers ({$>$}65 years old) in a low-speed frontal deceleration. The study proposed new methods to estimate the inertial properties of the head of the volunteers based on external measurements that reduced the error of previously published methods. The estimated mean peak axial force (Fz) was -164.38 {$\pm$}35.04 N in the young group and -170.62{$\pm$}49.82 N in the elderly group. The average maximum shear force (Fx) was -224.42{$\pm$}54.39 N and -232.41{$\pm$}19.23 N in the young and elderly group, respectively. Last, the estimated peak bending moment (My) was 13.63{$\pm$}1.09 Nm in the young group and 14.81{$\pm$}1.36 Nm in the elderly group.

  abstract = {Objective The objective of this study is to generate age targeted versions of the male and female Global Human Body Models Consortium (GHBMC) occupant human body models (HBMs), to validate each in frontal impacts, and to assess rib fracture probability of each.Methods Six age targeted models were developed based on the GHBMC average male and small female occupant models (M50-O v6.0 and F05-O v6.0, respectively). All age targeted models were modified to represent population means for height, weight, shape, and relevant material properties. The thin plate spline method was used to morph models, and material properties were modified using available literature. Validation focused on chest response. Models were evaluated in a rigid body frontal chest impact at 6.7 m/s. Furthermore, the male and female age targeted models were evaluated against published data from 40 km/hr and 30 km/hr frontal sled tests respectively.Results Chest deflections and landmark kinematics reasonably matched the respective corridors in the M50-O and F05-O aged models. Regional probability of rib fracture was assessed using probabilistic methods based on cortex strain. Increasing rib fracture with age was observed in both impacts for both sexes. For the rigid chest impact, the M50-O 70YO resulted in 10 ribs exceeding 50\% probability of fracture whereas the younger ages reported 4 to 6 ribs exceeding the same probability. In the same simulation, the F05-O 70YO resulted in 8 regions exceeding 50\% probability of rib fracture as opposed to 3 and 0 such regions at the youngest ages. Sled simulation demonstrated similar trends. The 70YO age adjusted models best aligned with the reported extent of fractures from the referenced PMHS studies, which tend to be composed of subjects of advanced age.Conclusions Age targeted HBMs demonstrated increased fracture probability with age when subjected to equivalent impacts. Gross model kinematics approximate PMHS data but showed little difference between targeted age models. The findings indicate that while gross kinematics are unaffected by age-targeting models, such models can capture trends of increased thoracic injury risk observed in experimental and field studies, and further suggest their potential use to target interventions for vulnerable driving populations, such as older adults.},

  abstract = {Objective: Injury risk curves estimate motor vehicle crash (MVC) occupant injury risk from vehicle, crash, and/or occupant factors. Many vehicles are equipped with event data recorders (EDRs) that collect data including the crash speed and restraint status during a MVC. This study's goal was to use regulation-required data elements for EDRs to compute occupant injury risk for (1) specific injuries and (2) specific body regions in frontal MVCs from weighted NASS-CDS data.Methods: Logistic regression analysis of NASS-CDS single-impact frontal MVCs involving front seat occupants with frontal airbag deployment was used to produce 23 risk curves for specific injuries and 17 risk curves for Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 2+ to 5+ body region injuries. Risk curves were produced for the following body regions: head and thorax (AIS 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+), face (AIS 2+), abdomen, spine, upper extremity, and lower extremity (AIS 2+, 3+). Injury risk with 95\% confidence intervals was estimated for 15\textendash 105 km/h longitudinal delta-Vs and belt status was adjusted for as a covariate.Results: Overall, belted occupants had lower estimated risks compared to unbelted occupants and the risk of injury increased as longitudinal delta-V increased. Belt status was a significant predictor for 13 specific injuries and all body region injuries with the exception of AIS 2+ and 3+ spine injuries. Specific injuries and body region injuries that occurred more frequently in NASS-CDS also tended to carry higher risks when evaluated at a 56 km/h longitudinal delta-V. In the belted population, injury risks that ranked in the top 33\% included 4 upper extremity fractures (ulna, radius, clavicle, carpus/metacarpus), 2 lower extremity fractures (fibula, metatarsal/tarsal), and a knee sprain (2.4\textendash 4.6\% risk). Unbelted injury risks ranked in the top 33\% included 4 lower extremity fractures (femur, fibula, metatarsal/tarsal, patella), 2 head injuries with less than one hour or unspecified prior unconsciousness, and a lung contusion (4.6\textendash 9.9\% risk). The 6 body region curves with the highest risks were for AIS 2+ lower extremity, upper extremity, thorax, and head injury and AIS 3+ lower extremity and thorax injury (15.9\textendash 43.8\% risk).Conclusions: These injury risk curves can be implemented into advanced automatic crash notification (AACN) algorithms that utilize vehicle EDR measurements to predict occupant injury immediately following a MVC. Through integration with AACN, these injury risk curves can provide emergency medical services (EMS) and other patient care providers with information on suspected occupant injuries to improve injury detection and patient triage.},

These characteristics refer on the one hand to human physical vulnerability, and on the other hand to human (cognitive) capacities and limitations. People regularly make errors unintentionally and are not always able to perform their tasks as they should. This brings us to the question whether a Safe System approach is a bridge too far for India or could it be a source of inspiration. I believe that a Safe System could also be of importance for India. Not, of course, in the sense that the measures, as they have been implemented in the Netherlands and in Sweden, could be copied on a one-to-one basis for the Indian situation; the countries differ too much. Nor can the Sustainable Safety principles be applied in India without any adaptations. The challenge will then be to translate these principles to the Indian (road traffic) conditions and society.},

Finite element (FE) head models are important tools to assess injury risks and design personal protective equipment. However, current FE head models are mainly developed based on the midsize male, failing to account for the significant morphological variation that exists in the skull and brain. The objective of this study was to develop a statistical head geometry model that accounts for size and shape variations among the adolescent and young adult population. Methods To represent subject-specific geometry using a homologous mesh, threshold-based segmentation of head CT scans of 101 subjects between 14 and 25 years of age was performed, followed by landmarking, mesh morphing, and projection. Skull and scalp statistical geometry models were then developed as functions of age, sex, stature, BMI, head length, head breadth, and tragion-to-top of head using generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA), principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate regression analysis. Results The statistical geometry models account for a high percentage of morphological variations in scalp geometry (R2=0.63), outer skull geometry (R2=0.66), inner skull geometry (R2=0.55), and skull thickness (error {$<$} 1 mm) Conclusions Skull and scalp statistical geometry models accounts for size and shape variations among the adolescent and young adult population were developed as functions of subject covariates. These models may serve as the geometric basis to develop individualized head FE models for injury assessment and design of head-borne equipment.},

The Wiberg patella classification is a method of distinguishing shape differences in the axial plane of the patella that can be used to connect shape differences to observed mechanics. This study uses the Wiberg patella classification to differentiate variance in a statistical shape model describing changes in patella morphology and height. We investigate how patella morphology influences force distribution within the patellofemoral joint. The Wiberg type I patella has a more symmetrical medial and lateral facet while the type III patella has a larger lateral facet compared to medial. The second principal component of the statistical shape model described shape variation that qualitatively resembled the different Wiberg patellas. We generated patellofemoral morphologies from the statistical shape model and integrated them into a musculoskeletal model with a twelve degrees-of-freedom knee. We simulated an overground walking trial with these morphologies and recorded patellofemoral mechanics and ligament forces. An increase in patellar ligament force corresponded with an increase in patella height. Wiberg type III patellas had a sharper patella apex which related to lower ratios of quadriceps tendon forces to patellar ligament forces.

  abstract = {The patellofemoral joint plays a crucial mechanical role during walking and running. It increases the knee extensor mechanism's moment arm and reduces the knee extension muscle forces required to generate the extension moment that supports body weight, prevents knee buckling and propels the centre of mass. However, the mechanical implications of moment arm variation caused by patellofemoral and tibiofemoral motion remain unclear. We used a data-driven musculoskeletal model with a 12-degree-of-freedom knee to simulate the knee extension moment arm during walking and running. Using a geometric method to calculate the moment arm, we found smaller moment arms during running than during walking in the swing phase. Overall, knee flexion causes differences between running and walking moment arms as increased flexion causes a posterior shift in the tibiofemoral rotation axis and patella articulation with the distal femur. Moment arms were also affected by knee motion direction and best predicted by separating by direction instead of across the entire gait cycle. Furthermore, we found high inter-subject variation in the moment arm that was largely explained by out-of-plane motion. Our results are consistent with the concept that shorter moment arms increase the effective mechanical advantage of the knee and may contribute to increased running velocity.},

  abstract = {Finite element (FE) modeling is an important tool for studying the cervical spine in normal, injured and diseased conditions. To understand the role of mechanical changes on the spine as it goes from a normal to a diseased or injured state, experimental studies are needed to establish the external response of young, normal cervical spinal segments compared to injured or degenerated cervical spinal segments under physiologic loading. It is important to differentiate injured or degenerated specimens from young, normal specimens to provide accurate experimental results necessary for the validation of FE models. This study used seven young, normal fresh adult cadaver cervical spine segments C2\textendash T1 ranging in age from 20 to 51 years. Prior to testing, the spines were graded in three ways: specimen quality, facet degeneration and disc degeneration. Spine segments were tested in flexion/extension, and the range of loads applied to the specimens was 0.33, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0Nm. These loads resulted in rotations in the direction of loading as the primary response to loading. In general, results for young, normal specimens showed greater flexibility in flexion and less flexibility in extension than results previously reported in the literature. The flexion/extension curves are asymmetric with a greater magnitude in flexion than in extension. These experimental results will be used to validate FE models of young, normal cervical spines.},

  abstract = {Computational models of the human brain are widely used in the evaluation and development of helmets and other protective equipment. These models are often attempted to be validated using cadaver tissue displacements despite studies showing neural tissue degrades quickly after death. Addressing this limitation, this study aimed to develop a technique for quantifying living brain motion in vivo using a closed head impact animal model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) called CHIMERA. We implanted radiopaque markers within the brain of three adult ferrets and resealed the skull while the animals were anesthetized. We affixed additional markers to the skull to track skull kinematics. The CHIMERA device delivered controlled, repeatable head impacts to the head of the animals while the impacts were fluoroscopically stereo-visualized. We observed that 1.5\,mm stainless steel fiducials ({$\sim$}8 times the density of the brain) migrated from their implanted positions while neutral density targets remained in their implanted position post-impact. Brain motion relative to the skull was quantified in neutral density target tests and showed increasing relative motion at higher head impact severities. We observed the motion of the brain lagged behind that of the skull, similar to previous studies. This technique can be used to obtain a comprehensive dataset of in vivo brain motion to validate computational models reflecting the mechanical properties of the living brain. The technique would also allow the mechanical response of in vivo brain tissue to be compared to cadaveric preparations for investigating the fidelity of current human computational brain models.},

  abstract = {Head injury models are important tools~to study concussion biomechanics but are impractical for real-world use because they are too slow. Here, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate regional brain strains instantly and accurately by conceptualizing head rotational velocity profiles as two-dimensional images for input. We use two impact datasets with augmentation to investigate the CNN prediction performances with a variety of training-testing configurations. Three strain measures are considered, including maximum principal strain (MPS) of the whole brain, MPS of the corpus callosum, and fiber strain of the corpus callosum. The CNN is~further tested using an independent impact dataset (N\,=\,314) measured in American football. Based on 2592 training samples, it achieves a testing R2 of 0.916 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.014 for MPS of the whole brain. Combining all impact-strain response data available (N\,=\,3069), the CNN achieves an R2 of 0.966 and RMSE of 0.013 in a 10-fold cross-validation. This technique may enable a clinical diagnostic capability to a sophisticated head injury model, such as facilitating head impact sensors in concussion detection via a mobile device. In addition, it may transform current acceleration-based injury studies into focusing on regional brain strains. The trained CNN is publicly available along with associated code and examples at https://github.com/Jilab-biomechanics/CNN-brain-strains. They will be updated as needed in the future.},

This study investigated an embedded method to explicitly incorporate white matter axonal fibers into an existing 50th percentile male brain model. The white matter was decomposed into myelinated axon tracts and an isotropic ground substance that had similar material properties to gray matter. The axon tract bundles were derived from a population-based tractography template explicitly modeled using 1-D cable elements. The axonal fibers and ground substance material were implemented using hyper-viscoelastic constitutive models, which were calibrated using white and gray matter brain tissue material testing data available in the literature. Finally, the new axon-based model was extensively validated for brain-skull relative deformation under various loading conditions (n\,=\,17) and showed good biofidelity compared to other brain models. Through these analyses, we demonstrated the applicability of this method for incorporating axonal fiber tracts into an existing FE brain model. The axon-based model will be a useful tool for understanding the mechanisms of TBI, evaluating tissue-based injury metrics, and developing injury mitigation systems.},

Values measured by MRI were larger than those measured by BIA. MRI data showed that the percentage of fat was significantly higher in the upper arm compared to the thigh in both men and women.

  abstract = {In vehicle collisions, the occupant׳s torso is accelerated in a given direction while the unsupported head tends to lag behind. This mechanism results in whiplash motion to the neck. In whiplash experiments conducted for animals, pressure transients have been recorded in the spinal canal. It was hypothesized that the transients caused dorsal root ganglion dysfunction. Neck motion introduces volume changes inside the vertebral canal. The changes require an adaptation which is likely achieved by redistribution of blood volume in the internal vertebral venous plexus (IVVP). Pressure transients then arise from the rapid redistribution. The present study aimed to explore the hypothesis theoretically and analytically. Further, the objectives were to quantify the effect of the neck motion on the pressure generation and to identify the physical factors involved. We developed a hydrodynamic system of tubes that represent the IVVP and its lateral intervertebral vein connections. An analytical model was developed for an anatomical geometrical relation that the venous blood volume changes with respect to the vertebral angular displacement. This model was adopted in the hydrodynamic tube system so that the system can predict the pressure transients on the basis of the neck vertebral motion data from a whiplash experiment. The predicted pressure transients were in good agreement with the earlier experimental data. A parametric study was conducted and showed that the system can be used to assess the influences of anatomical geometrical properties and vehicle collision severity on the pressure generation.},

Unlike existing approaches that rasterize agents and map information as 2D images or operate in a graph representation, our approach extends ideas from point cloud learning with dynamic temporal learning to capture both spatial and temporal information by splitting trajectory prediction into both spatial and temporal dimensions. In the spatial dimension, agents can be viewed as an unordered point set, and thus it is straightforward to apply point cloud learning techniques to model agents' locations. While the spatial dimension does not take kinematic and motion information into account, we further propose dynamic temporal learning to model agents' motion over time. Experiments on the Argoverse motion forecasting benchmark show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract = {The objective of the study was to investigate the biomechanical response of the intact cranium. Unembalmed human cadavers were used in the study. The specimens were transected at the base of the skull leaving the intracranial contents intact; x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained. They were fixed in a specially designed frame at the auditory meatus level and placed on the platform of an electrohydraulic testing device via a six-axis load cell. Following radiography, quasistatic loading to failure was applied to one of the following sites: frontal, vertex, parietal, temporal, or occipital. Retroreflective targets were placed in two mutually orthogonal planes to record the localized temporal kinematics. Applied load and piston displacement, and the output generalized force (and moment) histories were recorded using a modular digital data acquisition system. After the test, x-ray and CT images were obtained, and defleshing was done. Biomechanical responses were nonlinear. Microfailures were identified in the force-deflection response before reaching the ultimate load carrying capacity. Displaced and nondisplaced fractures of the outer and inner tables occurred. Unique changes in the local kinematics confirmed the fracture pattern. Peak forces, deflections, stiffnesses and energies ranged from 3.4 to 11.9 kN, 6.9 to 20 mm, 467 to 1290 N/mm, and 10.8 to 104.2 J, respectively. A comparison of this quasistatic data with the preliminary dynamic studies have indicated an approximately two-to-one relationship between dynamic and quasistatic strength (forces) with no such tendency in the deformations. These results suggest that the cranium is a deformation sensitive structure. This is of critical importance in the design of injury mitigating systems such as loading platforms, helmets, and farm machinery.}

  abstract = {It is common knowledge that whiplash-associated disorders are soft-tissue-related. Rear-end crashes account for a majority of trauma. Specific objective diagnoses have eluded clinicians because of the soft tissue nature of the disorder. Sophisticated tools such as magnetic resonance images are inconclusive. The disorder is recognized in the Western world with significant societal impact and staggering economic costs. An increased level of awareness towards safety from the vehicle user coupled with the above factors and an interest by the automotive community to improve vehicle component designs have accelerated research in the area of whiplash-associated disorders from various perspectives. One of the main emphases has been to clearly delineate the mechanisms of the disorder. Consequently, the objective of this article is to describe the postulated mechanisms of injury and biomechanical studies attempting to prove the hypotheses. Results indicate that structures such as the facet joint are involved in chronic pain, and the kinematics of this joint are such that it undergoes characteristic motions during the early stages of rear impact acceleration. The presence of the transient nonphysiologic reverse curve, i.e., upper head-neck flexion is attributed to headaches, and the concomitant existence of lower cervical extension (particularly the inferior facet joints) during the early stages of rear impact acceleration are attributed to the mechanism of neck pain in whiplash. These studies have provided a fundamental basis for understanding the mechanism of the two most common complaints in whiplash, headache and neck pain.},

  abstract = {This study was conducted to provide force and acceleration corridors at different velocities describing the dynamic biomechanics of the lateral region of the human head. Temporo-parietal impact tests were conducted using specimens from ten unembalmed post-mortem human subjects. The specimens were isolated at the occipital condyle level, and pre-test x-ray and computed tomography images were obtained. They were prepared with multiple triaxial accelerometers and subjected to increasing velocities (up to 7.7 m/s) using free-fall techniques by impacting onto a force plate from which forces were recorded. A 40-durometer padding (50-mm thickness) material covering the force plate served as the impacting boundary condition. Computed tomography images obtained following the final impact test were used to identify pathology. Four specimens sustained skull fractures. Peak force, displacement, acceleration, energy, and head injury criterion variables were used to describe the dynamic biomechanics. Force and acceleration responses obtained from this experimental study along with other data will be of value in validating finite element models. The study underscored the need to enhance the sample size to derive probability-based human tolerance to side impacts.},

  abstract = {Current neck injury criteria are based on matching upper cervical spine injuries from piglet tests to airbag deployment loads and pairing kinematics from child dummies. These ``child-based'' scaled data together with adult human cadaver tolerances in axial loading are used to specify neck injury thresholds in axial compression and tension, and flexion and extension moment about the occipital condyles; no thresholds are specified for any other force or moment including lateral bending. The objective of this study was to develop a testing methodology and to determine the lateral bending moment injury threshold under coronal loading. Post mortem human subjects (PMHS) were used. Specimens consisted of whole body and isolated head-neck complexes with intact musculature. Intact specimen positioning included: sitting PMHS upright on a rigid seat, supporting the torso by a plate, maintaining Frankfurt plane horizontal. Isolated head-neck complexes were fixed at T1 with the occiput connected via a custom apparatus to a testing device to induce lateral bending motion. Head angular and linear accelerations and angular velocities were computed using a pyramid nine accelerometer package on the head; specimen-specific physical properties including center of gravity and moments of inertia in the three-dimensions; and equations of equilibrium. These data were used to determine neck loads at the occipital condyles. No specimens sustained injuries, identified by palpation, x-rays, CT, and autopsy. Results from 24 tests indicated that PMHS head-neck complexes can tolerate 75 Nm of coronal moment at low axial load without failure, and this level may be used as an initial estimate of the injury reference value under lateral loading to the human head-neck complex.},

  abstract = {The incidence of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) in the US has reached epidemic proportions with well over 2 million new cases reported each year. TBI can occur in both civilians and warfighters, with head injuries occurring in both combat and non-combat situations from a variety of threats, including ballistic penetration, acceleration, blunt impact, and blast. Most generally, TBI is a condition in which physical loads exceed the capacity of brain tissues to absorb without injury. More specifically, TBI results when sufficient external force is applied to the head and is subsequently converted into stresses that must be absorbed or redirected by protective equipment. If the stresses are not sufficiently absorbed or redirected, they will lead to damage of extracranial soft tissue and the skull. Complex interactions and kinematics of the head, neck and jaw cause strains within the brain tissue, resulting in structural, anatomical damage that is characteristic of the inciting insult. This mechanical trauma then initiates a neuro-chemical cascade that leads to the functional consequences of TBI, such as cognitive impairment. To fully understand the mechanisms by which TBI occurs, it is critically important to understand the effects of the loading environments created by these threats. In the following, a review is made of the pertinent complex loading conditions and how these loads cause injury. Also discussed are injury thresholds and gaps in knowledge, both of which are needed to design improved protective systems.}

  abstract = {Purpose This study aimed to establish radiographic standard values for cervical spine morphometry, alignment, and range of motion (ROM) in both male and female in each decade of life between the 3rd and 8th and to elucidate these age-related changes. Methods A total of 1,230 asymptomatic volunteers underwent anteroposterior (AP), lateral, flexion, and extension radiography of the cervical spine. There were at least 100 men and 100 women in each decade of life between the 3rd and 8th. AP diameter of the spinal canal, vertebral body, and disc were measured at each level from the 2nd to 7th cervical vertebra (C2\textendash C7). C2\textendash C7 sagittal alignment and ROM during flexion and extension were calculated using a computer digitizer. Results The AP diameter of the spinal canal was 15.8~{$\pm~$}1.5 [mean~{$\pm~$}standard deviation (SD)] mm at the mid-C5 level, and 15.5~{$\pm~$}2.0~mm at the C5/6 disc level. The disc height was 5.8~{$\pm~$}1.3~mm at the C5/6 level, which was the minimum height, and the maximum height was at the C6/7 level. Both the AP diameter of the spinal canal and disc height decreased gradually with increasing age. The C2\textendash C7 sagittal alignment and total ROM were 13.9~{$\pm~$}12.3\textdegree{} in lordosis and 55.3~{$\pm~$}16.0\textdegree, respectively. The C2\textendash C7 lordotic angle was 8.0~{$\pm~$}11.8\textdegree{} in the 3rd decade and increased to 19.7~{$\pm~$}11.3 in the 8th decade, whereas the C2\textendash C7 ROM was 67.7~{$\pm~$}17.0\textdegree{} in the 3rd decade and decreased to 45.0~{$\pm~$}12.5 in the 8th decade. The extension ROM decreased more than the flexion ROM, and lordotic alignment progressed with increasing age. There was a significant difference in C2\textendash C7 alignment and ROM between men and women. Conclusions The standard values and age-related changes in cervical anatomy, alignment, and ROM for males and females in each decade between the 3rd and 8th were established. Cervical lordosis in the neutral position develops with aging, while extension ROM decreases gradually. These data will be useful as normal values for the sake of comparison in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Background Assessment of contact forces is essential for a better understanding of mechanical factors affecting progression of osteoarthritis. Since contact forces cannot be measured non-invasively, computer simulations are often used to assess joint loading. Contact forces are to a large extent determined by muscle forces. These muscle forces are computed using optimization techniques that solve the muscle redundancy problem by assuming that muscles are coordinated in a way that optimizes performance (e.g., minimizes muscle activity or metabolic energy). However, it is unclear which of the many proposed performance criteria best describes muscle coordination. Research question Which performance criterion best describes muscle recruitment patterns and knee contact forces recorded using electromyography (EMG) and load cell instrumented prostheses?. Methods We solved the muscle redundancy problem based on six different groups of performance criteria: muscle activations, volume-scaled activations, forces, stresses, metabolic energy, and joint contact forces. Computed muscle excitations and knee contact forces during over-ground walking were validated against recorded EMG signals and measured contact forces for four subjects with instrumented knee prostheses in the ``Grand Challenge Competition to Predict in Vivo Knee Loads'' dataset. Results Performance criteria based on either stress or muscle activation (either unscaled or scaled by muscle volume), both to a power of 3 or 4, resulted in the best agreement between measured and simulated values. These performance criteria outperformed all other criteria in terms of agreement between simulated muscle excitations and EMG, whereas good agreement between measured and predicted contact forces was also observed for minimization of contact forces and metabolic energy. Significance Given the large differences in accuracy obtained with different performance criteria (e.g., root mean square errors of contact forces differed up to 0.45 body weight), the results of our study are important to improve the validity of in silico assessment of joint loading.},

  abstract = {Objective: Many recent studies have suggested that brain deformation resulting from a head impact is linked to the corresponding clinical outcome, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Even though several finite element (FE) head models have been developed and validated to calculate brain deformation based on impact kinematics, the clinical application of these FE head models is limited due to the time-consuming nature of FE simulations. This work aims to accelerate the process of brain deformation calculation and thus improve the potential for clinical applications. Methods: We propose a deep learning head model with a five-layer deep neural network and feature engineering, and trained and tested the model on 1803 total head impacts from a combination of head model simulations and on-field college football and mixed martial arts impacts. Results: The proposed deep learning head model can calculate the maximum principal strain for every element in the entire brain in less than 0.001s (with an average root mean squared error of 0.025, and with a standard deviation of 0.002 over twenty repeats with random data partition and model initialization). The contributions of various features to the predictive power of the model were investigated, and it was noted that the features based on angular acceleration were found to be more predictive than the features based on angular velocity. Conclusion: Trained using the dataset of 1803 head impacts, this model can be applied to various sports in the calculation of brain strain with accuracy, and its applicability can even further be extended by incorporating data from other types of head impacts. Significance: In addition to the potential clinical application in real-time brain deformation monitoring, this model will help researchers estimate the brain strain from a large number of head impacts more efficiently than using FE models.},

  abstract = {Material properties of the brain have been extensively studied but remain poorly characterized. The vast variations in constitutive models and material constants are well documented. However, no study exists to translate the variations into disparities in impact-induced brain strains most relevant to brain injury. Here, we reviewed a subset of injury-relevant brain material properties either characterized in experiments or adopted in recent head injury models. To highlight how variations in measured brain material properties manifested in simulated brain strains, we selected six experiments that have provided a complete set of brain material model and constants to implement a common head injury model. Responses resulting from two extreme events representing a high-rate cadaveric head impact and a low-rate in vivo head rotation, respectively, varied substantially. We hypothesized, and further confirmed, that the time-varying shear moduli at the appropriate time scales (e.g., \textasciitilde 5\,ms and \textasciitilde 40\,ms corresponding to the impulse durations of the major acceleration peaks for the two impacts, respectively), rather than the initial or long-term shear moduli, were the most indicative of impact-induced brain strains. These results underscored the need to implement measured brain material properties into an actual head injury model for evaluation. They may also provide guidelines to better characterize brain material properties in future experiments and head injury models. Finally, our finding provided a practical solution to satisfy head injury model validation requirements at both ends of the impact severity spectrum. This would improve the confidence in model simulation performance across a range of time scales relevant to concussion and sub-concussion in the real-world.},

  abstract = {Numerous head injury models exist that vary in mesh density by orders of magnitude. A careful study of the mesh convergence behavior is necessary, especially in terms of strain most relevant to brain injury. To this end, as well as to investigate the effect of element integration scheme on simulated strains, we re-meshed the Worcester Head Injury Model at five mesh densities (\textasciitilde\,7.2\textendash 1000~k high-quality hexahedral elements of the brain). Results from explicit dynamic simulations of three cadaveric impacts and an in vivo head rotation were compared. First, scalar metrics of the whole brain only considering magnitude were used, including peak maximum principal strain and population-based median strain. They were further extended to deep white matter regions and the entire brain elements, respectively, to form two ``response vectors'' to account for both magnitude and distribution. Using benchmark enhanced full-integration elements (C3D8I), a minimum of 202.8~k brain elements were~necessary to converge for response vectors of the deep white matter~regions. This model was further used to simulate with reduced integration (C3D8R). We found that hourglass energy higher than the common~rule of thumb (e.g., up to 44.38\% vs.\,{$<$}\,10\% of internal energy) was necessary to maintain comparable strain relative to C3D8I. Based on these results, it is recommended that a human~head injury model should have a minimum number of 202.8\,k elements, or~an average element size of no larger than 1.8~mm, for the brain. C3D8R formulation with relax stiffness hourglass control using a high scaling factor is also recommended to achieve sufficient accuracy without substantial computational cost.},

  abstract = {Advanced neuroimaging provides new opportunities to enhance head injury models, including the incorporation of white matter (WM) structural anisotropy. Information from high-resolution neuroimaging, however, usually has to be ``down-sampled'' to match a typically coarse brain mesh. To understand how this mesh-image resolution mismatch affects impact simulation and subsequent response sampling, we compared three competing anisotropy implementations (using either voxels, tractography, or a multiscale submodeling) and two response sampling strategies (element-wise or tractography-based, using brain mesh or neuroimaging for region segmentation, respectively). Using the combination of high resolution options as a baseline, we studied how the choice in each individual category affected the resulting injury metrics. By simulating a recorded loss of consciousness head impact, we found that injury metrics including peak strain and injury susceptibility in the deep WM regions based on fiber strain, but not on maximum principal strain, were sensitive to the anisotropy implementation, response sampling, and region segmentation. Overall, it was recommended to use tractography for anisotropy implementation and response sampling, and to employ neuroimaging for region segmentation, because they led to more accurate injury metrics. Further refining mesh locally via submodeling was unnecessary. Brain strain responses were also parametrically found to be closer to that from minimum fiber reinforcement, consistent with the fact that the majority of WM had a rather high degree of fiber dispersion. Finally, the upgraded Worcester Head Injury Model incorporating WM anisotropy was successfully re-validated against cadaveric impacts and an in vivo head rotation (``good'' to ``excellent'' validation with an average Correlation Analysis score of 0.437 and 0.509, respectively). These investigations may facilitate further continual development of head injury models to better study traumatic brain injury.},

  abstract = {Successful validation of a head injury model is critical to ensure its biofidelity. However, there is an ongoing debate on what experimental data are suitable for model validation. Here, we report that CORrelation and Analysis (CORA) scores based on the commonly adopted relative brain-skull displacements or recent marker-based strains from cadaveric head impacts may not be effective in discriminating model-simulated whole-brain strains across a wide range of blunt conditions. We used three versions of the Worcester Head Injury Model (WHIM; isotropic and anisotropic WHIM V1.0, and anisotropic WHIM V1.5) to simulate 19 experiments, including eight high-rate cadaveric impacts, seven mid-rate cadaveric pure rotations simulating impacts in contact sports, and four in vivo head rotation/extension tests. All WHIMs achieved similar average CORA scores based on cadaveric displacement~(\textasciitilde\,0.70; 0.47\textendash 0.88) and strain (V1.0: 0.86; 0.73\textendash 0.97 vs. V1.5: 0.78; 0.62\textendash 0.96), using the recommended settings. However, WHIM V1.5 produced \textasciitilde\,1.17\textendash 2.69 times strain of the two V1.0 variants with substantial differences in strain distribution as well (Pearson correlation of \textasciitilde\,0.57\textendash 0.92) when comparing their whole-brain strains across the range of blunt conditions. Importantly, their strain magnitude differences were similar to that in cadaveric marker-based strain (\textasciitilde\,1.32\textendash 3.79 times). This suggests that cadaveric strains are capable of discriminating head injury models for their simulated whole-brain strains~(e.g., by using CORA magnitude sub-rating alone or peak strain magnitude ratio), although the aggregated CORA may not. This study may provide fresh insight into head injury model validation and the harmonization of simulation results from diverse head injury models. It may also facilitate future experimental designs to~improve~model validation.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of disability and mortality. Finite element-based head models are promising tools for enhanced head injury prediction, mitigation and prevention. The reliability of such models depends heavily on adequate representation of the brain\textendash skull interaction. Nevertheless, the brain\textendash skull interface has been largely simplified in previous three-dimensional head models without accounting for the fluid behaviour of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its mechanical interaction with the brain and skull. In this study, the brain\textendash skull interface in a previously developed head model is modified as a fluid\textendash structure interaction (FSI) approach, in which the CSF is treated on a moving mesh using an arbitrary Lagrangian\textendash Eulerian multi-material formulation and the brain on a deformable mesh using a Lagrangian formulation. The modified model is validated against brain\textendash skull relative displacement and intracranial pressure responses and subsequently imposed to an experimentally determined loading known to cause acute subdural haematoma (ASDH). Compared to the original model, the modified model achieves an improved validation performance in terms of brain\textendash skull relative motion and is able to predict the occurrence of ASDH more accurately, indicating the superiority of the FSI approach for brain\textendash skull interface modelling. The introduction of the FSI approach to represent the fluid behaviour of the CSF and its interaction with the brain and skull is crucial for more accurate head injury predictions.},

  abstract = {This paper aims at investigating the action prediction problem from a pure kinematic perspective. Specifically, we address the problem of recognizing future actions, indeed human intentions, underlying a same initial (and apparently unrelated) motor act. This study is inspired by neuroscientific findings asserting that motor acts at the very onset are embedding information about the intention with which are performed, even when different intentions originate from a same class of movements. To demonstrate this claim in computational and empirical terms, we designed an ad hoc experiment and built a new 3D and 2D dataset where, in both training and testing, we analyze a same class of grasping movements underlying different intentions. We investigate how much the intention discriminants generalize across subjects, discovering that each subject tends to affect the prediction by his/her own bias. Inspired by the domain adaptation problem, we propose to interpret each subject as a domain, leading to a novel subject adversarial paradigm. The proposed approach favorably copes with our new problem, boosting the considered baseline features encoding 2D and 3D information and which do not exploit the subject information.},

  abstract = {Realistic biomechanical models of the human head should accurately reflect the mechanical properties of all neurocranial bones. Previous studies predominantly focused on static testing setups, males, restricted age ranges and scarcely investigated the temporal area. This given study determined the biomechanical properties of 64 human neurocranial samples (age range of 3~weeks to 94~years) using testing velocities of 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5~m/s in a three-point bending setup. Maximum forces were higher with increasing testing velocities (p\,{$\leq$}\,0.031) but bending strengths only revealed insignificant increases (p\,{$\geq$}\,0.052). The maximum force positively correlated with the sample thickness (p\,{$\leq$}\,0.012 at 2.0~m/s and 3.0~m/s) and bending strength negatively correlated with both age (p\,{$\leq$}\,0.041) and sample thickness (p\,{$\leq$}\,0.036). All parameters were independent of sex (p\,{$\geq$}\,0.120) apart from a higher bending strength of females (p\,=\,0.040) for the 3.5~-m/s group. All parameters were independent of the post mortem interval (p\,{$\geq$}\,0.061). This study provides novel insights into the dynamic mechanical properties of distinct neurocranial bones over an age range spanning almost one century. It is concluded that the former are age-, site- and thickness-dependent, whereas sex dependence needs further investigation.},
