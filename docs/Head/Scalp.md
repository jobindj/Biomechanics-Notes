# Scalp

The scalp extends over the cranium (from the forehead in the front to the back till the neck). It consists of five layers. On the outside is the skin and the deepest layer is the pericranium that attaches to the skull bones. Layers of loose and strong connective tissues are present in between the skin and pericranium.

The energy absorbed during an impact can be highly dependent on the scalp thickness [@dekegel2019].

## Morphology

| Ungar [@ungar2018] | -          | -           | 7 mm          | Thickness reduces with age, approx at 50 years |

### Occipital

In impact tests of the scalp, Thurlow [@thurlow1963] reported occipital scalp thickness between 1.5 and 6.4 mm
